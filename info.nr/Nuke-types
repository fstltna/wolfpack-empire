                             Concept : Nuke Types

NAME
   Nuke-types - Description of different kinds of nuclear weapons

Level: Expert

There are two different types of nuclear devices in Empire: fission bombs, fu-
sion bombs.  Both fission and fusion  bombs  perform  similarly,  with  fusion
bombs giving "more bang for the buck".

In  general,  the only way to avoid damage by a nuclear detonation is to avoid
the area prior to and during actual detonation.  "Hardening" missiles (in  si-
los)  is the only exception, and even that cannot protect from a direct hit by
the larger nuclear devices.

The details of the nuclear devices present in Empire can  be  seen  using  the
show command.  The meaning of the fields are as follows:

     name  The nukes name.
      lcm  The amount of lcm needed to build the nuke
      hcm  The amount of hcm needed to build the nuke
      oil  The amount of crude oil required to build it.
      rad  The number of radioactive products required to build it.
    avail  The avail (work) required to build the nuke.
     tech  The minimum tech level required to construct the nuke.
      res  The minimum research level required to construct the nuke.
        $  The cost of the nuke to construct.
     blst  The blast type of the nuke
      dam  The damage rating of the nuke
      lbs  the  weight  of the warhead, limiting missile and plane nuclear de-
           vice carrying capacity.
abilities  Special abilties, if any

The abilities are as follows:

neutron  Creates much more severe nuclear fallout.

As a guide (these numbers are subject to change):
   [##:##] Command : show nuke build

   Printing for tech level '300'

   50kt  fission  60  60   30   90    60  300   0 $ 25000

   [##:##] Command : show nuke capab

   Printing for tech level '300'
                 blst dam lbs tech res $        abilities
   10kt  fission    3  70   4  280   0 $  10000
   15kt  fission    3  90   5  290   0 $  15000
   50kt  fission    3 100   6  300   0 $  25000

The larger the megatonnage, the more damage done by the weapon.   Effects  (as
in  the  real  world)  can only be determined by experimentation, although re-
search suggests that radioactivity left behind by nuclear detonations may have
lasting effects.
