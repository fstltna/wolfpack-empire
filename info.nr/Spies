NAME
   Spies - How spies work

Level: Expert

There  is  a  land  unit type "spy".  These can be very valuable land units to
have wandering around the planet...

Spies are very special land units.  They are able to  march  into  any  sector
(owned or unowned) and look about.  Of course, if you are marching in unallied
territory, there is a chance you will get caught.

If a spy is caught by a friendly or neutral country, the country  will  get  a
message  that  a  spy was spotted in their country.  If the spy is caught by a
hostile or at war nation, the spy gets shot on the spot.  The chance  of  get-
ting caught while marching about is inverse to the efficiency of the spy.  So,
at 100%, a spy has a 10% chance of getting caught.  At 10%, a spy has  a  100%
chance of getting caught.  Thus, you want efficient spies.

Spies  are  also  very  fragile.   If  they  are caught in any kind of combat,
shelling, bombing, etc. and take ANY damage at all, they die.

Spies may also be snuck on shore via ships using the  "assault"  command.   If
you  assault a sector using just spies, a 100% spy has a 60% chance of getting
caught, which increases to 100% for a 20% spy.

You may locate spies using the "llookout" or the "spy" command.

Use your imagination on how to eradicate errant spies. ;-)

Submarines may carry up to two spy units.

When unloaded from a ship, spies are not given over to the owner of the sector
as other units are.
