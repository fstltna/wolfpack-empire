SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : ndump <NUKES>

The  ndump  command  displays  all  information on some or all of your nuclear
devices.  Each nuke's information is printed on one very  long  line.   Fields
are separated by a single space.

This command is designed to be used for input to an empire tool such as "ve".

In  the  syntax  of  the ndump command <NUKES> are the ships on which you wish
information (see "info Syntax").

An ndump command lists all selected nuclear devices headed by:

   Sun Feb  9 22:16:37 1997
   DUMP NUKES 855544597
   id x y num type

The first line is the date.  The second line is the "DUMP  NUKES  <timestamp>"
where  the  <timestamp> field is the current timestamp.  The third line is the
columns which are output.

      x       x location
      y       y location
      num     always 1 for backward compatibility
      type    type of nuke

A typical usage might be:
   [##:##] Command : ndump #5
which would list data for all nukes in realm #5.

A ndump lists each of your nukes in the specified area.  The header line is  a
list of fields that correspond to the order that ndump prints the nuke info.
