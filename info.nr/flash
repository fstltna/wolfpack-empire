                               Command : FLASH

NAME
   flash - Send a message directly to a friend's terminal

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : flash <CNUM/CNAME> [<MESSAGE>]

The  <CNUM/CNAME>  argument  is either the number or name of the recipient na-
tion.

flash allows instant communication between friendly nations.   flash  has  two
different syntaxes.  You can either send your friend a one line message as in:
   [##:##] Command : flash Foobots Hi there, I'm back from lunch

Or you can send a multi-line message:
   [##:##] Command : flash Foobots

   > Hi there.
   > I ate Fodderland for lunch.
   > .

You can end a multi-line flash with a '.' (period) on a line all by itself.

If  you  do not wish to receive any flash messages from your friends, then you
can temporarily turn the feature off by typing "toggle flash".

Note that if the person you are flashing is allied to you,  you  will  be  in-
formed  if they are not logged in or not accepting flashes when you attempt to
flash them.  This only works when *they* are allied with you, since you  would
normally see them logged in or not using "players"
