                              Command : DISABLE

NAME
   disable - Disable Updates

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : disable

No updates will fire if you disable them.  The "show updates" command will re-
port the fact.

Disabling updates this way does not stop the Empire clock.   Stuff  using  the
clock,  like BTU growth, continues normally.  Should a scheduled update be ac-
tually missed, however, the Empire clock automatically recalibrates, to  main-
tain  the  fixed  number  of ETUs between updates.  This effectively stops the
clock.

You should not use this command as a tool for implementing your update  sched-
ule!   Enabling and disabling updates by hand is far too error prone, and your
players can't trust the show command to find out when the next  update  really
is.  Use the update schedule file instead.
