NAME
   Basics - The basic rules for playing Empire

Level: Basic

First, there are no real rules to playing empire.  What you do is what you do.
There are some general guidelines here, and some deities may be more forgiving
than others.

One  player,  one country.  You may NEVER use any country other than your own.
It is OK for two people to play one country but it is NEVER OK for one  person
to  play  two countries.  If you are caught doing this, your countries will be
removed from the game.  In addition, your registrations for future  games  may
be declined.  DON'T DO IT.

OK, but what do I do when I'm away?

     1)  you may turn over your country to someone who has never played anyone
     else's country in that game.  You MUST tell the deity if you do  this  as
     he/she/it will be watching who is playing what.
     2) you may turn your country over to the deity.

Bugs:  if  you find a bug, you are REQUIRED to report it to the deity.  I will
not let other people know about the bug and in most cases, you may exploit  it
until  it  is  fixed.  Punishment for use without telling: at least $50,000 or
getting your country removed from the game.

Denial-of-service attacks are forbidden.  Any form of attack that  prevents  a
player from connecting to the server is against the rules.  This includes let-
ter bombing.
