                              Command : EXECUTE

NAME
   execute - Execute a batch file

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : execute <INPUT FILE>

This command reads Empire commands from <INPUT FILE> and executes them.

You  can't  execute a batch file from within a batch file at this time.  Redi-
rections in batch files are not supported either.

Note: The execute protocol is broken by design.  Not all clients  support  it.
Some clients get confused by funny file names, or redirections.
