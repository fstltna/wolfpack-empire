                              Command : CONVERT

NAME
   convert - Change conquered civilians into uncompensated workers

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : convert <SECTS> <NUMBER>

The  convert  command  converts "enemy" (captured) populace into uncompensated
workers.  If the sector is not actually conquered, no civilians will  be  con-
verted.  If you convert all the civs in a sector, then the sector is no longer
occupied (i.e. you become the "oldowner" of the sector).

After the program has collected any necessary information it  will  list  each
sector where civilians are converted.

Note:  you  must  have enough military in the sectors to force the populace to
become uncompensated workers -- about 10%. Land units count toward this  at  a
value  equal  to  the number of mil required to build them. Security units are
even more efficient, counting for more than their base value, and increase the
number converted.

There must also be mobility in the sector to be converted (see "info Mobility"
for the exact formula).
