                             Command : SWAPSECTOR

NAME
   swapsector - Swap two sectors

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : swapsector <SECT> <SECT>

This  command  allows  the deity to pick up two sectors and then put them back
down in each-other's location.  It is  particularly  handy  for  changing  the
shape of start islands when setting up a game.  For example, a piece of an is-
land may be cut off by a mountain, and so to fix it you could  just  swap  the
mountain  over  to  some  other part of the island.  All aspects of the sector
(e.g. resources, commodities) get transferred to the new location.   The  only
change that is made is that dist paths are wiped.
