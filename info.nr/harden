   harden - Place missiles into protective silos

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : harden <PLANES> <LEVEL>

The  "harden"  command is used to install missiles into protective silos which
can prevent their destruction during a nuclear or  non-nuclear  attack.   Each
successive "harden" command will add to the current hardness level of the mis-
sile in question.

Each point of hardening uses one unit of  heavy  construction  materials,  and
costs $5.

Once  a missile has been placed in a silo (hardened to a level greater than 0)
it can no longer be moved.
