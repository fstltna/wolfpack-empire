                                Command : WIRE

NAME
   wire - Read announcements

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : wire [yes|no|<days>]

The  wire  command  is  used to read the announcements sent you by other coun-
tries.

After reading all your announcements you may mark them as being read by speci-
fying  "yes"  or not by specifying "no" as an argument.  If an argument is not
supplied then you will be prompted to either answer "yes" or "no"  to  marking
announcements  as being read.  If you supply or answer "no", the announcements
will remain pending but you will not be reminded of them.

You can read announcements that you have previously marked as read by specify-
ing the <days> argument.  For example:
   [##:##] Command : wire 3
would print the announcements from the last three days.  If you specify <days>
argument, you will not be prompted to mark the announcements as being read.

In order to read telegrams, use the 'read' command.
