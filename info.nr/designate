                             Command : DESIGNATE

NAME
   designate - Specify sector utilization

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : designate <SECTS> <DESIGNATION>

In  Empire all sectors have a "designation".  The "designation" represents the
principal industry or activity taking place in that area.  When  a  sector  is
designated  a  harbor, for example, the civilians in the sector start building
shipyards and docks, (with a little help from any military present).

If the redesignated sector is already declared to be something  else,  and  is
efficient,  then  the workers will have to tear down the existing construction
and then build the new sector.  The workers dismantle  existing  sectors  four
times faster than they can build.

As work progresses the efficiency will climb toward a maximum of 100%.

If you don't specify the <DESIGNATION> argument in the command line as in:
   [##:##] Command : designate 1:3,2:5
The  program  will  ask for each sector specified what you want the new sector
designation to be.

However, if you wish to designate one or several sectors to be one  particular
thing and don't want to be asked on each one you can type something like:
   [##:##] Command : designate -6:6,-3:3 ?type=f +
This  will  designate all fortresses that you own within three sectors of your
capital to be highways.

Note that you cannot re-designate bridge spans.

Normally, each point of efficiency added costs you $1. Some sectors  may  cost
more,  and  some may also require the expenditure of lcms and/or hcms from the
sector. See the "show" command and "info Sector-types" for details.
