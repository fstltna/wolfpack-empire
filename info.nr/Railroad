NAME
   Railroad - How railroads work

Level: Expert

Trains  are  land units with capability "train".  They can't be loaded on land
units, but they can be loaded on ships, subject to the usual restrictions  for
non-light and heavy land units.

Unlike  other  units,  trains  can enter a sector only if it has (operational)
railroad track.

If option RAILWAYS is disabled, a sector has railroad track  as  long  as  its
rail  infrastructure  efficiency  is non-zero.  Train mobility cost depends on
rail infrastructure efficiency  (see  "info  Mobility").   Spy  and  satellite
reports show approximate rail infrastructure efficiency in column "rl eff".

If  option RAILWAYS is enabled, all highway-like sectors are railways, and the
track is operational as long as the sector is at least 5% efficient.  A sector
is highway-like if its mobility cost at 100% is zero (column mob cost in "show
sect s").  Operational railways additionally extend track into  adjacent  sec-
tors  that  are  at  least 60% efficient and owned by the same nation.  Sector
selector track gives the number of  operational  railways  within  one  sector
range.   Spy  and  satellite  reports show the presence of track in column "rl
eff".  To visualize your railway network, try "sect # ?track#0".
