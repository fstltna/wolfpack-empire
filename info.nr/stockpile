                             Command : STOCKPILE

NAME
   stockpile - Designate members of a "stockpile"

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : stockpile <STOCKPILE> <NUKE/STOCKPILE>

The  stockpile  command  is  used  to  specify the stockpile groupings of your
nukes.

   [##:##] Command : stockpile <STOCKPILE> <NUKE/STOCKPILE>
In the syntax <STOCKPILE> is the alphabetic character to be used as the stock-
pile designation.  This character can be chosen from the set of upper or lower
case a-z and tilde (~).  The pseudo-stockpile  specification  tilde  specifies
all nukes not currently in any stockpile.

The  specification  of  nukes,  <NUKE/STOCKPILE>, can have one of several syn-
taxes:

   example     meaning
   -------     -------
   23          nuke 23
   2/14/23     nukes 2, 14, and 23
   c           all nukes currently in stockpile `c'
   ~           all nukes currently in the "null" stockpile
   2,3         all nukes in sector 2,3
   -1:3,0:2    all nukes in the square area bounded by -1,0 & 3,2

All stockpiles, (with the exception of the `~' stockpile), are limited to some
maximum  size  and  you will be informed how many nukes can be added when this
command is run.

Having nukes organized into stockpiles can be very helpful in loading, moving,
etc.,  in that fewer commands are required to perform these commands on groups
of nukes if they can be specified by stockpile number.

Note that you can remove nukes from a stockpile by  adding  them  to  the  `~'
stockpile.  e.g.
   [##:##] Command : stockpile ~ A
This command would purge all nukes from stockpile `A'.
