                              Command : APROPOS

NAME
   apropos - Searches info pages for information on a topic

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : apropos <searchword> [maxhits]

The  Empire  info  pages are organized by subject. It can sometimes be hard to
find the exact page with the information in which you are interested.  To  get
a list of subjects containing the word you are looking for, type:
   [##:##] Command : apropos <word>

without the < and > brackets.

You can then type:
   [##:##] Command : apropos bridge
to  get  a  list  of  Empire  commands  and info topics which contain the word
bridge, as well as the line that mentions it.

Apropos is not case sensitive, thus the above example  will  find  pages  with
Bridge or bridge (or even bRiDgE).

By  default, apropos exits when 100 hits are found.  You can change this value
with an optional second parameter.
