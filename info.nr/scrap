SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : scrap <s|l|p> <SHIPS | UNITS | PLANES>

This  command  allows  you to scrap planes/units/ships when you no longer need
them.

Ships may only be scrapped in own or friendly 60% harbors.  Planes may only be
scrapped  in  own or allied 60% airfields.  Land units may only be scrapped in
own or allied sectors.

When scrapping a unit, plane or ship, you receive materials equal to  2/3  the
amount  used to build it. The materials are put in the sector where the scrap-
ping occurs.

If you scrap a ship or unit that has planes  on  board,  the  planes  will  be
transferred to the sector.
