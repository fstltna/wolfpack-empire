NAME
   financial - Show all the outstanding loans in the world

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : financial

The  financial report shows all of the outstanding loans in the world, so that
the loan sharks can better calculate the ability of a  prospective  client  to
pay.

It  does  not  show  loan offers pending, however, just those loans which have
been accepted.

If a loan is past due (i.e. the loanee has defaulted on  the  loan)  the  "(in
arreras)"  is  printed  after  the line of that loan.  Loans in default may be
"sharked" up and collected upon.
