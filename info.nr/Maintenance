                            Concept : Maintenance

NAME
   Maintenance - The cost to maintain ships, planes, and land units.

Level: Expert

During  each  update,  nations  must  pay  to  maintain their units, ships and
planes.

The cost to maintain a ship, or land-unit is:

           .001 * cost of thing * ETUs/update

The cost to maintain a plane is:

           .001 * cost of thing * ETUs/update + 5 * mil_cost * crew

Note that this cost can be changed by the deity.

Also note that if you have purchased high-tech items, and your tech is not  at
least 85% of the item's tech, you are charged double to maintain the item.

Also  note  that  engineering land units costs 3 times what normal units cost,
after the tech is figured in.

If you can not afford to pay maintenance costs then your unit will lose  ETU/5
points  of  efficiency.   It  won't  go  below its minimum efficiency, though.
Thus, if you were playing in a 60 ETU game, and you did not pay  your  mainte-
nance  costs  for a 40% frigate, then the frigate would drop to 28% efficiency
at the first update, and to 20% at the second update.
