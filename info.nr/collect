SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : collect <LOAN>

The  collect command is the loan-shark's delight!  Through the collect command
overdue loans can be "cleared up".

If you should find that you have a problem debtor who refuses  to  pay  up  on
your kind loan you can always seize one or more of his/her sectors.

To settle up accounts on overdue loan #9 you would type:
   [##:##] Command : collect 9
The  program  would  then ask which sector you would like to claim as just and
rightful compensation for the outstanding debt.

   What sector do you wish to confiscate?

To which you reply with the coordinates of a sector owned by  your  debtor  to
which you are adjacent.  Any adjacent sector includes any sector you have that
borders the sector you wish to confiscate.

The program then paws over the sector and assesses its value.  If  the  amount
you  are  owed  exceeds this amount the sector becomes yours!  If the value of
the sector is close enough to the amount you are owed the debt  is  considered
to be repaid.

Any  che  in  the  area are left alone.  Thus, if the original owner takes the
sector back over, the che would continue their  battle  against  the  original
owner, not the new owner.

In  addition,  ships,  land  units, planes and nuclear stockpiles are not col-
lected.  Those remain the property of the owner of the sector.

Standing military in the sector are reduced to 1 and he becomes the latest and
greatest addition to your standing army.

Mobility of the collected sector remains unchanged.
