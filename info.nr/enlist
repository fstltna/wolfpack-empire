                               Command : ENLIST

NAME
   enlist - Turn civilians into military

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : enlist <SECTS> <NUMBER>

The  enlist command converts civilians into military in the sectors specified.
Military "created" by the enlist command are actually reserves called up  from
your  country's  military  reserve.   If your country has no military reserves
(created by "demobilize") then no civilians will be converted and no  military
will be generated.

After  the  program has collected any necessary information, it will list each
sector where civilians answer the call and the number who showed  up  followed
by the total number of military resulting (in parentheses).

If  <NUMBER>  is  a  positive number that many draftees will be sought in each
sector regardless of any military already in the sector.

If <NUMBER> is a negative number of the form -xxx, then an enlistment quota is
established  and  the draft board will attempt to enlist enough in each sector
to bring the total number of military up to xxx in each sector.

Although the program tries to draft the specified number of civilians in  each
sector  only  one-half  of the civilians in a sector can be called upon at any
one time.

Civilians in conquered sectors (the conquered populace) will not serve in your
armed forces.
