                              Command : NAVIGATE

NAME
   navigate - Move ship or fleet around

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : navigate <SHIP/FLEET> <ROUTE|DESTINATION>

The  navigate  command is the "move" command applied to the sea.  You can con-
trol one ship or an entire fleet with it, but they must all start in the  same
sector.

A ship must have at least one crew (which may be civilian or military, but not
an uncompensated worker) to be navigated.  When you navigate, you see the  hex
of sectors around the flagship.

The  program will prompt with the maximum and minimum mobility of the ships in
the fleet, and its current position in the form:

   <57.0:23.5: -6,4>

which means the ships have between 23.5 and 57 mobility units, and are in sec-
tor  -6,4.  You may indicate the direction you would like the fleet to move by
typing a string of letters consisting of any combination of the following:

   y  for up-left
   u  for up-right               y    u
   g  for left                    \  /
   j  for right               g  --  --  j
   b  for down-left               /  \
   n  for down-right             b    n

Other commands you may type while navigating are:

   M  for map
   B  for bmap
   f  to change flagship
   i  to list ships you are navigating
   v  to view oil content and fish
   r  for radar
   l  to look at land and nearby ships
   s  for sonar
   m  to sweep mines
   d  to drop mines
   h  for end of movement

The "radar" command will cause the flagship to use it's radar,  if  any.   You
may  also  give  a ship number or fleet or group of ships on the same line: "r
12/13/14/73"

The "lookout" and "sonar" commands work in the same way as radar.

The "map" command will give you a map surrounding the  current  position.   By
default,  it  will  be  around  the  flagship.  You can also supply additional
parameters:
   [##:##] Command : <32.3: g 6,2>M 3 ls

is equivalent to a "smap" command. like this:
   [##:##] Command : map 3 ls
The "bmap" command works in the same way, it is equivalent to a  "sbmap"  com-
mand.

The  "flagship"  command  will  the  change the flagship.  By default, it will
select next ship in the list, but you may also specify a flagship.

The "drop" command will drop mines using ships with mine capability.  You  can
specify  the  ship  number  or  fleet or groups of ships and the number of sea
mines on the same line: "d 12/13 10".  An omitted unit number defaults to  the
flagship,  for  example  "d 10" drops ten sea mines from the flagship.  If you
omit the number of sea mines as well, the flagship will drop one mine.

The "sweep" command will have the minesweepers in the navigating group  search
for mines in the current sector.  This costs them the equivalent of 1 sector's
mobility.

Note: the lookout, radar, sonar, drop and sweep commands use BTUs, just as  if
you'd typed them separately from the command line.

Since  the <ROUTE> can be specified in the command line, simple ship movements
are often typed as a single line, such as:
   [##:##] Command : nav 19 jjjh

Or some movements may be done partly on the command line and  partly  interac-
tively:

   [##:##] Command : nav 18 jj

   Flagship is pt   patrol boat (#18)
    . .
    . .
   <112.7:112.7: -4,-2> v
   pt   patrol boat (#18) @ -4,-2 0% sea
    . .
    . .
   <112.7:112.7: -4,-2> gh
   pt   patrol boat (#18) stopped at -6,-2
   Path taken: jjg

You  may  also simply specify the destination sector.  In this case, the ships
will take a shortest known path to the destination sector.

For example,
   [##:##] Command : nav 18 -6,-2

   Flagship is pt   patrol boat (#10)
    . .
    . .
   <104.2:104.2: -6,-2> h
   pt   patrol boat (#18) stopped at -6,-2
   Path taken: jjg

The formula for the movement cost for 1 sector is:

           480 / (( speed + speed * (50+tech)/(200+tech) ) * Efficiency/100)

Moving a ship through a sector that has been mined risks hitting a  mine  (see
"info  Hitchance").  Minesweepers can remove up to five mines per pass through
a sector (indicated by the message "Sweep...").  Minesweepers  also  take  1/2
normal damage from mines.

Also, note that some things may affect you while you are moving. Forts belong-
ing to hostile countries will fire at you when you come within range.  Hostile
land/sea/air  units  may  fire  at/bomb your ships, if they're on interdiction
missions (see "info mission").  The chance of  bombs  hitting  your  ships  is
determined  by  the  ship that is easiest to hit (see "bomb" for the chance of
hitting).  Any damage incurred is divided evenly among the navigating ships.

If your enemy has a stack of missiles on interdiction mission, then they  will
automatically  fire  one  after another until all of your "valuable" ships are
sunk.

NOTE

While navigating, you cannot enter a sector that belongs  to  another  country
unless  they have FRIENDLY relations with you. This includes bridges, and har-
bors.
