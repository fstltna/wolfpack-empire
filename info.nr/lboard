                               Command : LBOARD

NAME
   lboard - Board enemy land unit

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : lboard [<VICTIM UNIT>] [<FROM SECT>]

The  lboard  command  enables  the owner of a sector to engage in hand-to-hand
combat with a land unit in that sector.  To board unit #5 from sector 1,-1 you
might type:
   [##:##] Command : lboard 5

The  program  will ask from which sector you wish to board and how many troops
to board with.

In order to board a land unit from a sector, the land unit must be in the sec-
tor, and the sector must have mobility.

Some things to note:

Any  land units in the combat will fight as if they were simply mil, i.e. they
won't get any offensive of defensive multiplier,  except  for  "marine"  units
which get their full bonus.  Similarly, units on land units don't have to take
morale checks, as they are fighting as mil.  Mil on the victim unit will still
die before units take casualties, however.

Note  that you can only board with as many mil that the unit you are trying to
board can hold.

See info "Attacking" for the exact procedure.
