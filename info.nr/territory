                             Command : TERRITORY

NAME
   territory - Assign various sectors to a specific territory

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : territory <SECTS> <NUMBER> [<FIELD>]

In  Empire,  sectors may be given a territory number.  This number may be used
in conditional statements as in:
   [##:##] Command : census # ?terr=27
The program will then give you a census report for all the sectors  that  have
been assigned the territory number "27".

In  this  sense  it  is essentially an extended "realm".  However, you are not
limited to rectangular regions and you have 99 values to choose from.

There are four independent territory fields terr, terr1, terr2, terr3 selected
by  field  arguments  0, 1, 2, 3, respectively.  Deities can use an additional
territory field dterr, selected by -1.  If the optional field argument is emp-
ty, terr is assumed for mortals and dterr for deities.

   [##:##] Command : territory #1 5 1

Would set terr1 to 5 for all sectors in realm 1.

   [##:##] Command : sect * ?terr1=6&terr2=12

If  terr1 was used to mark different islands and terr2=12 indicated productive
sectors, this would highlight all the productive sectors on island number 6.

Some possible uses include; all sectors distributing to a  particular  sector;
all coastal sectors; all sectors that have armed missiles in them.  And proba-
bly thousands that I haven't thought of. ;-)

To "unset" a territory, set its value to zero.

Note: terr and terr0 are the same.
