                             Concept : Happiness

NAME
   Happiness - How happiness is calculated at the update

Level: Expert

Happiness  is required for countries which have any sort of technology or edu-
cation at all, with greater levels being  required  as  the  expectation  (and
tech/edu levels) of the populace increases.  A country with an unhappy popula-
tion can expect a decrease in the "work" of some sectors.

Also, the morale of your land units is determined by  the  happiness  of  your
people.  The  morale of a unit can be set by the player, but the minimum level
allowable depends on happiness.  See "info morale" for details.

The "nation" command will display, among other things, your current  happiness
level.

The procedure determining happiness level is exactly the same for happiness as
it is for education (see "info Education") except for the fact that "happiness
log  base" is always 6.0 and "easy happiness" is always 5.0.  New happiness is
averaged with old happiness in the same way that education is averaged  except
that happiness averaging has its own line in the "version" output:
  Happiness is averaged over 48 time units.

It  has  also  been  rumored  that  increasing happiness will help to keep the
rebels in check somewhat, but the exact results are sketchy at best.
