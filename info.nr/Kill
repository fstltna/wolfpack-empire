NAME
   Kill - How to kill your process on the server

Level: Basic

At some point you may lose your connection to the game.  When this happens its
possible that the game will not log your country off and you will get  a  mes-
sage  saying that you are still playing the game.  This can be easily fixed by
the player if you type in the following.

          telnet your.local.empire.machine 6666
          coun <NAME>
          pass <PASSWORD>
          kill
          quit

What happens is that you are connecting directly to the Empire  Server.   From
there  you  enter  your  country name and password.  You can then kill the job
that's running and then quit so you can login again using the client.

This little trick will work on just about any Empire game.  Of course you need
to telnet to that game and and enter the correct country and password.

Its  a  good idea to write this down somewhere and DON'T LOSE it cause chances
are that you will have to use it at sometime.

Note that many clients offer a "kill" command which does this.
