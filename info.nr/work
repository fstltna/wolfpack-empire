                                Command : WORK

NAME
   work - Use engineers to raise sector efficiency

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : work <UNIT> <MOBILITY>

This  command causes a unit with the engineering ability to increase the effi-
ciency of a sector. (see info show for information on finding out unit  abili-
ties)

The increase in efficiency depends on mobility used. It costs a 100% efficient
land unit 6 mobility to raise a sector 1%  efficiency.   Less  efficient  land
units  are  charged proportionally higher amounts of mobility.  For example, a
50% land unit would be charged 12 mobility to raise the efficiency of a sector
by 1%.

If  the  sector  has been re-designated, the working unit will first tear down
the old, then start working on the new effic, in the same way that sectors up-
date normally.
