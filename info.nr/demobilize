                             Command : DEMOBILIZE

NAME
   demobilize - Change military into civilians

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : demobilize <SECTS> <NUMBER>

The  demob  command  returns soldiers from the military back to civilian life.
In addition, you have the option of placing the returning  GIs  into  the  na-
tion's  active reserve.  The active reserve provides a pool of available mili-
tary for a small salary (usually the same amount generated by a civilian)  and
provides  for quick mobilization of military during a threat to national secu-
rity.

If <NUMBER> is a positive number, that many military will  be  demobilized  in
each sector, regardless of any military already there.

If  <NUMBER>  is  a negative number, military beyond -<NUMBER> will be demobi-
lized in each sector.

As a result of demobilization, and as a "thank you" for serving their  country
in  its  time  of need, a "GI Bill" is given to each soldier to the tune of $5
each.

Troops can only be demobilized in sectors which have greater  than  60%  effi-
ciency, and only in "home sectors" (that is, not in occupied territory).

When  troops are successfully demobilized in a given sector, the number of new
civilians is printed, and the number in parentheses shows the total number  of
military left in that sector.

You  have the option of placing civilians on active reserve.  Civilians on ac-
tive reserve can later be enlisted but you must pay them to stay on.  General-
ly civilian on active reserve costs one tenth of what a military costs.
