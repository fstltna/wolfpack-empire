The  "sabotage"  command is used to blow up commodities and cause havoc in the
sector the spy is in.  Spies don't check relations and can cause damage to en-
emies  and allies.  Sabotage can only be done by spy units.  The spy must have
a shell to make an attempt.

Terrorizing your neighbors is dangerous work.  Spies can be caught or die dur-
ing a sabotage attempt.

Sabotage  can be more effective against enemy warehouses filled with explosive
or flammable materials.
