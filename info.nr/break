SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : break

In  Empire  your  sectors  are initially sanctuaries.  While in sanctuary your
people don't eat, work or reproduce.  They also can't be attacked.

Break removes the sanctuary protection from your country and forces your  peo-
ple  to  work for a living.  Sanctuaries become capitals, unless the deity set
up a different new designation.  You can't do any country development commands
until you break out of sanctuary.
