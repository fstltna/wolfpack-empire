NAME
   pdump - Dump raw plane information

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : pdump <PLANES> [<fields>]

The  pdump  command  displays  all  information on some or all of your planes.
pdump is a combination of plane and pstat.  Each plane's information is print-
ed on one very long line.  Fields are separated by a single space.

This command is designed to be used for input to an empire tool such as "ve".

In  the  syntax of the pdump command <PLANES> are the planes on which you wish
information, [<fields>] are the fields you wish to dump.   If  no  fields  are
specified, all fields are printed.  (see "info Syntax").

A pdump command lists all selected planes headed by:

   Sun Feb  9 22:16:37 1997
   DUMP PLANES 855544597
   <fields>

The  first line is the date.  The second line is the "DUMP PLANES <timestamp>"
where the <timestamp> field is the current timestamp.  The third line  is  the
columns which are output.

These columns represent the following fields which are also the selection cri-
teria for the command.

The following may be used as fields.  They must be entered  EXACTLY  as  shown
here (no partial pattern matching is done.)

      type     type of plane
      x        x location
      y        y location

      def      defense value
      acc      accuracy

      range    maximum range
      load     load rating
      fuel     amount of fuel used in one flight
      hard     hardness
      ship     ship number the plane is on
      land     land unit number the plane is on
      laun     launched into orbit?
      orb      orbiting synchronously?
      nuke     nuke name (if armed)

A typical usage might be:
   [##:##] Command : pdump #5
which would list data for all planes in realm #5.

A pdump lists each of your planes in the specified area.  The header line is a
list of fields that correspond to the order that pdump prints the plane info.
