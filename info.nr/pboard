                               Command : PBOARD

NAME
   pboard - Board enemy plane

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : pboard [<PLANE>]

The pboard command enables the owner of a sector to capture any planes another
player has trapped in that sector.  To board plane #6 you might type:
   [##:##] Command : pboard 6

In order to board a plane, the plane must be on the ground in  a  sector  that
you own.

Some things to note:

The  crew  of  the plane will attempt to blow up or disable the plane to avoid
capture.

The boarding parties do not recognize relations.  Thus "pboard *"  will  board
all planes in your territory whether owned by allies or enemies.
