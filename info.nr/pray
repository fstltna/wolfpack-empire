                                Command : PRAY

NAME
   pray - Interacting with the Deity

Level: Basic

There  is  one  country  in the game that has no material possessions yet owns
everything...  That country is country #0 (often  called  "The  Deity").   The
power  of this ethereal country is unbounded -- it can do anything from creat-
ing a civilian (as was the case with the first civilian), to literally  moving
mountains.

Despite this great power The Deity keeps his hands out of the game and country
#0 only gets involved when there is a problem with the source code, or prohib-
ited  activity  is suspected.  The most common form of prayer is the telegram;
if you should be in need of aid type:

   [##:##] Command : pray

When the program requests your message for The Deity, state it simply:

   Enter telegram for your Gracious Deity
   undo last line with ~u, print with ~p, abort with ~q, end with .
   <512> I can't do anything!!!!
   <488> HELP!!
   <481> .

If this doesn't get helpful results then you should send a second prayer  with
more specific details. e.g.

   <512> Every time I type any command which requires a BTU
   <461> I get dumped out of the game.  Can you help me?
   <413> .

This last message is sure to move the compassionate Deity to provide help.

In  general,  when you encounter problems, be as specific about them as possi-
ble. Include a transcript of the output of the problem, if available. The more
information  you provide, the easier it is for the deity to give you a quick &
fair fix for the problem.

If you prefer e-mail, the "version" command shows the deity's e-mail address.
