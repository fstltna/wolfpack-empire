                           Concept : Command Syntax

NAME
   Syntax - The Empire command syntax

Level: Basic

The Empire Shell (command interpreter) expects input in the form:
   [##:##] Command : VERB ARG1 ARG2 ...
VERB  is  any  one  of the Empire commands on the "command list" (what you see
when you type "list"-- e.g.  "map", "move", "info", etc).

The number of ARGs varies from command to command.  In  most  cases  the  ARGs
need  not  be  supplied on the command line; any that are not supplied will be
obtained by prompting.  The exception to this rule are  those  ARGs  that  are
enclosed in [square brackets] in the command list.  The presence of these ARGs
changes the way the command is carried out.

Certain basic argument types recur often and are abbreviated in the  following
ways.

<TYPE>  ::=  'se',  'sh',  'l',  or  'p' for sector, ship, land unit, or plane
   respectively.  If "sector" is not a possibility, then 's' will likely  suf-
   fice for "ship".

<CNUM/CNAME> ::= either a country number or a country name

<COMM>  ::= any one, (or unambiguous abbreviation), of the list of commodities
   found in "info Selector":

<LOAN> ::= loan number

<SECT> ::= sector coordinates in the form: x,y

<SECTS> ::= sector(s) in the form:

         lox:hix,loy:hiy ?cond&cond&...

   "lox", "hix", "loy", "hiy" are coordinates bounding the rectangular area to
   be considered

   "cond" is a condition of the form:

         <VALUE><OPERATOR><VALUE>

   <VALUE>  is  either a <COMM>, as above, a number in the range 0 to 65536, a
   sector designation, ("m" for mine, "c" for capital, etc), a  type  of  unit
   ("frigate", "cavalry", etc), or a selector found in "info Selector".
   <OPERATOR> can be any one of:
   <  less than
   =  equal
   >  greater than
   #  not equal

   Thus  "mob=100",  "ore#0",  "7=guns",  "civ#mil",  "des=b"  are examples of
   legitimate conditions, (note lack of embedded spaces), and
      [##:##] Command : census -3:3,-3:3 ?des=+&gun=5&mil>civ
   will list all highways within 3 of your capital with  exactly  5  guns  and
   more military than civilians.

   Similarly,
      [##:##] Command : deliver f -9:9,-9:9 ?f_del=0
   will  allow  you  to  set  up  food  delivery in all the sectors that don't
   already have food delivery.

   Note that "hix", "hiy", and "?cond" are all  optional.   Also,  the  entire
   "lox:hix,loy:hiy"  section may be replaced by either "#", "#0", "#1", "#2",
   or "#3", ... which refer to "realm"s which  you  can  define.   (See  "info
   realm".)   Note  that  "#" and "#0" are equivalent.  Also "*" refers to all
   sectors, and "@x,y:dist" refers to all sectors within dist of x,y.

<SHIP> ::= one ship number

<FLEET> ::= fleet designation, which may be  a  list  of  ships  separated  by
   slashes  (`/'),  a  fleet letter, the character tilde (`~') which means all
   ships not in a specific fleet, or a rectangular sector area.

<SHIP/FLEET> ::= either a single ship number or a fleet designation.

   Note that <FLEET> specifications may have an optional ?cond&cond...   argu-
   ment like that used for <SECTS> arguments.  For instance:
      [##:##] Command : ship ~ ?des=d&mil>5
   will  list all destroyers that have more than 5 military which are not cur-
   rently in any fleet.

The output from commands may also be sent to a file or another process by uti-
lizing these alternate syntaxes:

   [##:##] Command : VERB ARG1 ... > FILE
which sends the output to the file "FILE".

   [##:##] Command : VERB ARG1 ... >> FILE
which appends the output to the file "FILE".

   [##:##] Command : VERB ARG1 ... >! FILE
which sends the output to the file "FILE", replacing the file it if it already
exists.

   [##:##] Command : VERB ARG ... | PROGRAM [ARGS...]
which send the output of the command to the program  "PROGRAM"  with  optional
arguments  "ARGS".   This  is most useful when "PROGRAM" is some type of pager
like more(1) or less(1).

The Empire shell also recognizes a few control characters:

     name  meaning
interrupt  Abort command and return to Empire command level
     quit  Exit Empire
      EOT  Exit Empire
