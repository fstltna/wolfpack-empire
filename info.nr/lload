NAME
   lload - Load things onto land units

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : lload <COMMODITY> <UNITS> <AMOUNT>

SYNTAX

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : lload land <UNITS> <UNITS>

The  load  command  carries out the loading of units.  Commodities (like guns,
civs, food) can be loaded onto any unit capable of carrying them (to see  what
cargos a unit can carry, use the show command).

Some land units can carry extra-light planes (typically these are SAMs)

Some land units can carry other units

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : lload <COMMODITY> <UNITS> <AMOUNT>

In  the first form, the amount argument specifies the amount of the given com-
modity you wish to load on each unit specified.  Amounts greater than that al-
lowed  will be truncated to the maximum possible. Amounts less than 0 indicate
that you want to make the unit/army have that amount.  If  the  unit/army  has
less  than  that  amount,  more will be loaded. If the unit/army has more than
that amount, the commodity will be unloaded. For example,

   [##:##] Command : load food 3 -100

will cause unit 3 to load or unload food so that it has 100.  If  it  had  120
food, 20 would be unloaded. If it had 50 food, 50 would be loaded.

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : lload plane <UNITS> <PLANES>

In the second form, where you say "plane" instead of say "civ" a plane/missile
is loaded onto a unit.

See the "show" command for a table of the maximum amounts of each  items  that
can be carried on each unit type.

Note  that if either <UNITS> or <PLANES> does not start with a number (e.g. it
is of the form "a" or "*" or "#1" and not of the form 123 or 12,14)  then  you
will  not be given any error messages.  This is so that you can type something
like "lload plane * *" without getting a hundred error messages.
