                                Command : SPY

NAME
   spy - Snoop on adjacent enemy sectors

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : spy <SECTS>

The  spy command allows reconnaissance operations to enforce an oral treaty or
as preparation for an attack (or even for a prayer to the Deity).

The spy report will reveal, (in round figures), the numbers of troops,  civil-
ians, guns, shells, iron, and planes and the sector designation and efficiency
in neighboring sectors.

The sectors denoted by <SECTS> are those from which you are spying, (see "info
syntax"  for  format).  Note: you can only spy from sectors that have military
or land units in them.

Note that the number of BTUs consumed is dependent upon the number of  sectors
into which you spy, e.g., a 5x8 area costs one full BTU.

If  you  are  spying  on  an unallied country your spy could be apprehended...
his/her chances are dependent upon the number of patrolling  military  in  the
sector.

However,  having  a  recon  unit in the sector the spy is coming from enhances
your chances of succeeding even if the spy is caught.

If the other country has declared itself at war with you the spy will be  shot
and  the other country, (and the rest of the world, through the news), will be
warned that you tried to spy on him...

If the other country is neutral towards you the spy will be deported.

Spies will also report all non-owned planes and land units that exist  in  the
sector  you  are spying from, such as allied land units that have been marched
there, allied planes that have been landed there, spy units that have  marched
there and non-allied units that have been trapped there.

Note  that  spy units are not always seen.  There is a 10-100% chance of a spy
unit being seen by the spy command.  See "info Spies" for more information.

NOTE

Spies reporting on the tech level of enemy units are pretty inaccurate.   They
can vary by +/- 20 tech or so...
