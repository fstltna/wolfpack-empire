                                Command : LOAD

NAME
   load - Load goods, people, etc onto a ship

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : load <COMMODITY> <SHIPS> <AMOUNT>

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : load plane <SHIPS> <PLANES>

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : load land <SHIPS> <UNITS>

The  load  command  carries out the loading of ships.  Commodities (like guns,
civs, food) can be loaded onto any ship.  Missiles can  be  loaded  onto  nuke
subs  and  planes  can be loaded onto carriers.  Land units may be loaded onto
many ships.

The ship(s) must be in a harbor and the harbor must be at least 2% efficient.

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : load <COMMODITY> <SHIPS> <AMOUNT>

In the first form, the amount argument specifies the amount of the given  com-
modity  you  wish  to  load on each ship specified.  Amounts greater than that
allowed will be truncated to the maximum possible. Amounts less than  0  indi-
cate  that you want to make the ships have that amount. If the ships have less
than that amount, more will be loaded.  If  the  ships  have  more  than  that
amount, the commodity will be unloaded. For example,

   [##:##] Command : load food 3 -100

will  cause  ship  3 to load or unload food so that it has 100.  If it had 120
food, 20 would be unloaded. If it had 50 food, 50 would be loaded.

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : load plane <SHIPS> <PLANES>

In the second form, where you say "plane" instead  of  say  "civ"  planes  are
loaded  onto  ships.  Multiple planes may be given. Some may not be loaded, if
there is not enough room.

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : load land <SHIPS> <UNITS>

In the third form, where you say "land" instead of say "civ", a unit is loaded
onto  a ship. Multiple units may be given. Some may not be loaded, if there is
not enough room. (Note that planes on land units on ships can't be  used,  and
units  on  ships  generally  can't do much, like firing, marching, etc).  When
loading a land unit onto a ship, the unit will check to see that it is in sup-
ply before stepping on deck.  If it isn't, then it will try to resupply itself
(see info supply) and if it is not able to do that,  then  you  are  issued  a
warning.  Sailors don't like to go to sea without supplies.

See  "info  Ship-types"  for a table of the maximum amounts of each items that
can be carried on each ship type.

If you are loading things onto FRIENDLY ships, you need to type the numbers of
the  ships,  fleets  or  realms  will not work. I.e. if you do "load f s 999",
it'll load 999 food onto all your ships in fleet s. If you  do  "load  1/2/3/4
999  f",  it'll  try  to  load  food  onto ships 1, 2, 3, and 4, regardless of
whether they're yours or they belong to a friendly trading partner.

If you load something onto a friendly nation's ship, it  becomes  his  and  he
gets a telegram. If you load a unit, he gets any planes it may be carrying.

If  you  unload a plane or unit in a friendly nation's harbor, it becomes his.
If you unload a unit, he gets any planes it may be carrying.

Note that if any of <SHIPS>, <UNITS> or <PLANES> does not start with a  number
(e.g.  it  is of the form "s" or "*" or "#1" and not of the form 123 or 12,14)
then you will not be given any error messages.  This is so that you  can  type
something like "load land * *" without getting a hundred error messages.
