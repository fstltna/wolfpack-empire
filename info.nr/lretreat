SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : lretreat <UNIT/ARMY> <PATH> <CONDITIONS>

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : lretreat <UNIT/ARMY> q

The  lretreat  command  allows  you to examine or modify the retreat orders of
your land units.

The first argument selects land units to view or give orders for.  If an  army
designation  is  given when specifying orders, the orders apply to all members
of that army.

Retreat orders consist of a retreat path and conditions.

A retreat path 'h' orders the ships not to retreat.

With 'q' instead of a retreat path, the current retreat paths  and  conditions
will be listed.  The report format contains the following fields:

     lnd#  the unit number
unit type  the type of land unit; "cavalry", "engineer", etc.,
      x,y  the land unit's current location,
        a  the army designation letter (set by "army" command),
     path  the current retreat path,
 as army?  whether these are army retreat orders,
    flags  what conditions will trigger retreat.

For example:
   [##:##] Command : lretreat * q

   lnd#     unit type       x,y   ar path       as army? flags
      0 cav  cavalry        2,0      jjuuj               I
   1 unit

A  player  may give retreat orders for a land unit or an army.  Retreat orders
include a set of conditions that determine when the  army/unit  will  retreat,
and a path that the army/unit will follow.  When a condition is met for a par-
ticular land unit, the "as army?" field is checked. If it is Yes,  then  every
unit  in that army with army retreat orders retreats along the specified path.
If it is no, then the retreat orders apply to that unit only,  and  only  that
unit retreats.

When  a  land  unit is added to an army, it is given the retreat orders of the
first unit in that army that has army retreat orders and is in the  same  sec-
tor, if any exist.

Retreat orders are wiped when a land unit marches.

Retreat conditions are:

        Condition       Meaning
        i               Retreat when the unit is injured,
                        i.e. whenever the unit is damaged by gun fire
                        or bombs.
        b               Retreat when a plane bombs or tries to bomb
                        the unit.
        h               Retreat when helpless --- a unit is helpless
                        when it is fired upon, and no friendly
                        units/sectors (including the unit itself)
                        are able to fire back at the aggressor.

For  example, if the cavalry above was fired at, it would attempt to retreat 2
sectors, jj, using the normal amount of mobility  for  moving  2  sectors.  It
would then look like:

   lnd#     unit type       x,y   ar path       as army? flags
      0 cav  cavalry        2,0      uuj                 I
   1 unit
