                                Command : SHOW

NAME
   show - Characteristics of sectors, units, updates and more

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : show <land|nuke|plane|sector|ship> [b|s|c] [tech]

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : show <bridge|item|news|product|tower>

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : show <updates> [number]

The  show command shows characteristics of sectors, units (ships, planes, land
units and nukes), bridges (spans and towers), items,  news  and  products,  as
well as information on updates.

Characteristics  are  more fully described in separate info pages (Ship-types,
Nuke-types, etc.).

For sectors and units, a further parameter is required to indicate whether you
wish information about building (b), statistics (s) or capabilities (c) of the
selected type.

By default, unit characteristics are shown at 1.25 times your current technol-
ogy  level.   You  can ask for a lower level with the optional tech parameter.
Units beyond that level are not shown; you can only get information  on  units
that you are already or almost capable of building.

So, for example
   [##:##] Command : show nuke capabilities
will give something like

   Printing for tech level '325'
                 blst dam lbs tech res $        abilities
   10kt  fission    3  70   4  280  93 $  10000

   100kt fission    4 125   8  310 103 $  30000
