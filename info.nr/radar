                               Command : RADAR

NAME
   radar - Perform radar scan from ship or sector

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : radar [<SHIP/FLEET> | <SECTS>]

The  radar command bears some resemblance to modern high-resolution radar.  It
has a circular range dependent upon its efficiency.

To run land radar type:
   [##:##] Command : radar <SECTS>
where <SECTS> must be the sector where the radar station resides, or  an  area
that contains one or more radar stations.

The program will respond with the station's efficiency and range and then dis-
play the area.

What is displayed is dependent upon the range.   Sectors  within  1/3  of  the
range  as well as mountains, sea and wasteland are displayed with their sector
designations.  Other sectors are displayed as '?'.

A 100% radar station in a country with infinite technology on a clear day  has
a  range of 16.  The range is linearly related to efficiency; thus a 50% radar
station can see half as far as a 100% radar station.  The range is related  to
technology level in the "usual" way, i.e., it varies linearly with "technology
factor" as indicated in the nation report; see "info nation" and  "info  tech-
nology" for details.

Satellites will appear on the map as a '$'.

WARNING!  Land radar cannot spot submarines.

To run unit radar type:
   [##:##] Command : lradar <UNIT/ARMY>
where <UNIT/ARMY> is the number of a unit or an army designation.

To run naval radar type:
   [##:##] Command : radar <SHIP/FLEET>
where <SHIP/FLEET> is the number of a ship or a fleet designation.

Sea  radar  is  highly dependent upon what kind of ship you have and what kind
the opponent has.  (e.g., Battleships can see battleships far away but fishing
boats must be close together to see each other).

The  maximum  distance at which ship A can see ship B is dependent on two fac-
tors: the "spying" ability of ship A, and the "visibility" of ship B.  Battle-
ships  have  sophisticated  communications equipment which give them a maximum
spying range of 6 while fishing boats, having little such  equipment,  have  a
maximum  range of 2.  This factor is shown in a table in "info Ship-types" un-
der the heading "spy".  On the other hand, the ships vary in size  and  conse-
quently,  vary in visibility.  Battleships, oil derricks, and carriers are the
easiest to see; next come cargo ships, heavy cruisers and tenders, and so  on.
See "info Ship-types" for a chart.

Ship A will see ship B if the distance between them is less than:

                spy factor of ship A * visibility of ship B
   efficiency * ------------------------------------------- * technology factor
                                  20

Note  that, although subs can not be found via radar, destroyers automatically
use sonar so they can see subs.  Destroyer A will see submarine B if the  dis-
tance between them is less than:

                spy factor of ship A * visibility of ship B
   efficiency * ------------------------------------------- * technology factor
                                  20

   [##:##] Command : radar 50
