   pstat - Report statistics of plane, wing or planes in a give area

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : pstat [<PLANE> | <SECTS>]

The  pstat  command  is  a report of the varying statistics of your planes and
lists the info in a readable format.  Since your planes'  statistics  vary  by
tech  level,  this  is a very useful way to see what the attack, defense, etc.
modifiers are on a per-plane basis.

The <PLANE> and <SECTS> arguments are provided in case you only wish  to  look
at one plane or all planes within a given area.

pstat  expects  some  argument.   To  see all planes, use the argument '*', or
enter "pstat *".
