                             Command : SATELLITE

NAME
   satellite - Download data from a reconnaissance satellite

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : satellite <PLANE> [<se|sh|l> [?cond&cond&...]]

The  satellite  command  is  how  you get information from your satellites.  A
satellite must be in orbit (launched) before it will begin transmitting.   The
type of information you get from a satellite depends on what type of satellite
it is.

An ordinary satellite will return data that looks remarkably like "radar" out-
put.  If the satellite has "imaging" capabilities you will see the sector des-
ignations.  If not then you will see a '?' for inhabited sectors.

A satellite with imaging capabilities will also show ships and land units.

Spy satellites provide much more information.  Their output is  a  table  that
looks  remarkably  like "spy" output followed by another table listing all the
ships in the area with their owner, ship type, and efficiency.

Spy satellites with "imaging" capabilities can also see subs!

After launching, a satellite will take a while to come "on line".  During this
period, (shown by mobility being < 127), you cannot use the satellite.

If a satellite has been damaged, then it will only transmit partial data.  For
example, a 75% satellite will only display three out of  every  four  sectors.
Note  that it will always be the same 75% of sectors which are displayed (i.e.
it is not random), so you will gain nothing  by  repeatedly  downloading  data
from the satellite.

You  may also filter the information you receive from the satellite using con-
ditionals.  Here are some examples to show you how conditionals work.  In  all
of the following examples, we will assume that we are using satellite #28.

To list all airports:
   [##:##] Command : sat 28 se ?des=*
To list all airports owned by country #7:
   [##:##] Command : sat 28 se ?des=*&own=7
To list all ships in 12,14:
   [##:##] Command : sat 28 sh ?xloc=12&yloc=14
To list all land units:
   [##:##] Command : sat 28 l
To list all cavalry units:
   [##:##] Command : sat 28 l ?type=cavalry

For  a  complete list of conditionals you can use, see info Syntax.  Note that
the large radar map is only drawn when the output is not filtered:
   [##:##] Command : sat 28
