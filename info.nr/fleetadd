                              Command : FLEETADD

NAME
   fleetadd - Designate members of a "fleet"

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : fleetadd <FLEET> <SHIP/FLEET>

The fleetadd command is used to specify the fleet groupings of your ships.

   [##:##] Command : fleetadd <FLEET> <SHIP/FLEET>
In the syntax <FLEET> is the alphabetic character to be used as the fleet des-
ignation.  This character can be chosen from the set of upper or lower case a-
z and tilde (~).  The pseudo-fleet specification tilde specifies all ships not
currently in any fleet.

The specification of ships, <SHIP/FLEET>, can have one of several syntaxes:

   example     meaning
   -------     -------
   23          ship 23
   2/14/23     ships 2, 14, and 23
   c           all ships currently in fleet `c'
   ~           all ships currently in the "null" fleet
   2,3         all ships in sector 2,3
   -1:3,0:2    all ships in the square area bounded by -1,0 & 3,2

All fleets, (with the exception of the `~' fleet), are limited to some maximum
size and you will be informed how many ships can be added when this command is
run.

Having ships organized into fleets can be very  helpful  in  loading,  moving,
etc.,  in that fewer commands are required to perform these commands on groups
of ships if they can be specified by fleet number.

Note that you can remove ships from a fleet by adding them to the  `~'  fleet.
e.g.
   [##:##] Command : fleetadd ~ A
This command would purge all ships from fleet `A'.
