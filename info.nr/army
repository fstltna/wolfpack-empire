                                Command : ARMY

NAME
   army - Designate members of an "army"

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : army <ARMY> <UNIT/ARMY>

The army command is used to specify the army groupings of your units.

   [##:##] Command : army <ARMY> <UNIT/ARMY>
In the syntax <ARMY> is the alphabetic character to be used as the army desig-
nation.  This character can be chosen from the set of upper or lower case  a-z
and  tilde  (~).   The pseudo-army specification tilde specifies all units not
currently in any army.

The specification of units, <UNITS/ARMY>, can have one of several syntaxes:

   example     meaning
   -------     -------
   23          unit 23
   2/14/23     units 2, 14, and 23
   c           all units currently in army `c'
   ~           all units currently in the "null" army
   2,3         all units in sector 2,3
   -1:3,0:2    all units in the square area bounded by -1,0 & 3,2

All armies, (with the exception of the `~' army), are limited to some  maximum
size and you will be informed how many units can be added when this command is
run.

Having units organized into armies can be very  helpful  in  loading,  moving,
etc.,  in that fewer commands are required to perform these commands on groups
of units if they can be specified by army number.

Note that you can remove units from a army by adding them  to  the  `~'  army.
e.g.
   [##:##] Command : army ~ A
This command would purge all units from army `A'.
