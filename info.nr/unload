                               Command : UNLOAD

NAME
   unload - Inverse of load (above)

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : unload <COMMODITY> <SHIPS> <AMOUNT>

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : unload plane <SHIPS> <PLANES>

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : unload land <SHIPS> <UNITS>

The  unload  command is the opposite of load and follows the exact same syntax
...  so why look here for documentation?

The only thing to know is that unload won't unload more of a thing if the sec-
tor  already  has  999. For example, if a ship has 10 food, and the harbor has
994, you can only unload 5 of the 10 food.

Also, you must have Friendly relations with the owner of the harbor  in  order
to unload into it.
