                              Command : CAPITAL

NAME
   capital - Change the location of your capital

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : capital <SECTOR>

This  command  changes  the location of your nation's capital.  The new sector
must be of type "capital" or "mountain", and must be owned by you.  Your capi-
tal produces BTUs.  See "info BTU" for the exact rate of BTU production.

This command does not change your coordinate origin (where 0,0 is located), so
if you prefer your coordinates centered on your nation's capital, you must use
the origin command.  For example:
   [##:##] Command : capit -10,-4

   Your capital is now at -10,-4.

   [##:##] Command : orig -10,-4

   Designation of new origin requires revision of sector numbers.
   Origin at -10,-4 (old system) is now at 0,0 (new system).

If  the  unthinkable  should come to pass, and an enemy captures your capital,
bad things happen. Some happen once, immediately:

   1) You will lose half your cash, or $3K, whichever is more.
   2) Your enemy will gain half your cash times (1/5 + 4/5 * sector efficiency)

Re-taking a previously taken capital has no further effect. Once a new capital
has been declared with this command, you are again in peril of these two awful
things.

Some effects happen right away, and last until you use the  "capital"  command
to create a new capital. The effects are:

   3) You will not be able to use many commands (use the
      'list of commands' command to see the pitiful few you may still use)

   4) The rate at which you gain BTUs will dramatically decrease (see
      info BTU).
