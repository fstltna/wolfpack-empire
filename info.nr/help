                                Command : HELP

NAME
   help - Provide information on various topics

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : info [<SUBJECT|COMMAND|TOPIC|all>]

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : help [<SUBJECT|COMMAND|TOPIC|all>]

The  Empire  info  pages are organized by subject.  To get a list of subjects,
type:
   [##:##] Command : info
or
   [##:##] Command : help
You can then type:
   [##:##] Command : info Subject
to get a list of Empire commands and info topics which are related to the Sub-
ject  that  you  chose.  Note that Subjects always start with a capital letter
(this is to distinguish them from commands which are always lowercase).

To get info on the syntax of an Empire command, type:
   [##:##] Command : info command
where "command" is the command you're interested in.  Note that info about Em-
pire command syntax is always specified lower-case.

To get info about some Empire topic, type:
   [##:##] Command : info Topic
Where Topic is the name of some Empire topic that you're interested in.

Every  Empire  command  and topic belongs to at least one subject, and in some
cases more than one.

   [##:##] Command : info all
This will list all info pages.  Warning: this list is long!

As of this writing, some clients shanghai the help command to provide help  on
their  own command line extensions, but fail to integrate server help.  If the
help command doesn't work for you, try the info command instead.
