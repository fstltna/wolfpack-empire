SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : sdump <SHIPS> [<fields>]

The  sdump  command  displays  all  information  on some or all of your ships.
sdump is a combination of ship, cargo, and sstat.  Each ship's information  is
printed on one very long line.  Fields are separated by a single space.

This command is designed to be used for input to an empire tool such as "ve".

In  the  syntax  of  the sdump command <SHIPS> are the ships on which you wish
information, [<fields>] are the fields you wish to dump.   If  no  fields  are
specified, all fields are printed.  (see "info Syntax").

An sdump command lists all selected ships headed by:

   Sun Feb  9 22:16:37 1997
   DUMP SHIPS 855544597
   <fields>

The  first  line is the date.  The second line is the "DUMP SHIPS <timestamp>"
where the <timestamp> field is the current timestamp.  The third line  is  the
columns which are output.

These columns represent the following fields which are also the selection cri-
teria for the command.

The following may be used as fields.  They must be entered  EXACTLY  as  shown

list of fields that correspond to the order that sdump prints the ship info.
