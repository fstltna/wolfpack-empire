NAME
   realm - Print out or modify one of your "realms"

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : realm <NUMBER> <SECTS>

The  realm command allows you to manipulate the contents of the "realm"s asso-
ciated with your country which provide a convenient way  to  save  coordinates
that are frequently used (see "info syntax" for use of realm arguments).

In  the  syntax of the realm command <NUMBER> is the number of the realm to be
set.

The <SECTS> argument is optional; if included, the specified realm will be set
to <SECTS>; if omitted the coordinates of the specified realm will be printed.

   [##:##] Command : realm 1

   Realm 1 is -3:3,3:3

   [##:##] Command : realm 1 -3:2,4
   [##:##] Command : realm 1

   Realm 1 is now set to -3:2,4:4

If  the  <NUMBER>  argument  is omitted, the coordinates of all realms will be
printed.

Also note that the <SECTS> argument may use the "#" form of  realm  specifica-
tion.
   [##:##] Command : realm 0 #1
Now realm 0 is set to -3:2,4:4.
