   ldump - Dump raw land unit information

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : ldump <UNITS> [<fields>]

The  ldump command displays all information on some or all of your land units.
ldump is a combination of land, lcargo, and lstat.  Each ship's information is
printed on one very long line.  Fields are separated by a single space.

This command is designed to be used for input to an empire tool such as "ve".

In  the  syntax  of  the ldump command <UNITS> are the land units on which you
wish information, [<fields>] are the fields you wish to dump.   If  no  fields
are specified, all fields are printed.  (see "info Syntax").

An ldump command lists all selected land units headed by:

   Sun Feb  9 22:16:37 1997
   DUMP LAND UNITS 855544597
   <fields>

The  first  line  is the date.  The second line is the "DUMP LAND UNITS <time-
stamp>" where the <timestamp> field is the current timestamp.  The third  line
is the columns which are output.

These columns represent the following fields which are also the selection cri-
teria for the command.

The following may be used as fields.  They must be entered  EXACTLY  as  shown
here (no partial pattern matching is done.)
