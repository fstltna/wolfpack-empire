                                Command : ARM

NAME
   arm - Load nuclear weapons onto planes or missiles

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : arm <PLANE> <NUKE> <airburst?>

The "arm" command loads nuclear devices aboard delivery systems such as planes
or missiles.

No nuclear weapons can be delivered unless they are first loaded aboard deliv-
ery  vehicles.   However,  until they are residing in a plane or missile, they
are considered invulnerable to attack (buried inside of mountains), and cannot
be used by any potential conqueror (they don't know the fail-safe codes).

You  decide whether the warhead will air-burst or ground-burst at the time you
arm it.  If you'd like to change air-burst/ground-burst later on, just arm the
plane/missile  again (in this case, the second argument will be ignored).  You
can see whether a nuke will air- or ground-burst using the "plane" command.
