SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : trade

The  trade report lists all ships, planes, land units and nukes that are being
sold and allows you to buy them.

It is based on a bidding system, and after the bidding time  has  passed,  the
transactions  are executed, and the highest bidder gets the goods (maybe.)  If
there are no bidders once the time passes, the goods stay on  the  market  and
the first bidder will get them.

Your bid must be higher than the currently high bid.

Typical output looks like:
   [##:##] Command : trade
