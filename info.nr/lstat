                               Command : LSTAT

NAME
   lstat - Report statistics of unit, army or units in a given area

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : lstat [<UNIT/ARMY> | <SECTS>]

The  lstat  command  is  a  report of the varying statistics of your units and
lists the info in a readable format.  Since your  units'  statistics  vary  by
tech  level,  this  is a very useful way to see what the attack, defense, etc.
modifiers are on a per-unit basis.

The <UNIT/ARMY> and <SECTS> arguments are provided in case you  only  wish  to
look at one unit or one army or all units within a given area.

Lstat  expects  an  argument.  To see every unit you own, give it the argument
'*', i.e. type "lstat *".

The report format contains the following fields:

     lnd#  the unit number
unit-type  the type of unit
      x,y  the unit's current location (relative to your origin),
      eff  the unit's efficiency,
     tech  the tech level of the unit
      att  the attack multiplier of the unit
      def  the defense multiplier of the unit
      vul  the vulnerablilty of the unit (see "info Damage")
      spd  the speed of the unit (see "info Mobility")
      vis  the visibility of the unit
      spy  the distance a unit can see
      rad  the maximum reaction radius of the unit
      rng  twice the distance the guns can fire, The range formula is  (rng/2)
           * ((tech + 50) / (tech + 200))
      acc  the firing accuracy of the unit
      fir  the number of guns that fire when the unit fires
