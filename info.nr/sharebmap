                             Command : SHAREBMAP

NAME
   sharebmap - Share parts of your bmap with another country

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : sharebmap <CNUM/CNAME> <SECTS> [<des>]

This  command  will share all of the information on your bmap with the country
<CNUM/CNAME>.  In order for it to work, they must be friendly towards you  and
your  bmaps  must  already  overlap  to some extent.  Note that your 'working'
bmaps are not compared for this, but rather your 'true' bmaps.  In particular,
you  can not fool the game into thinking that your bmaps overlap through using
the 'bdes' command.  See the bottom of 'info bmap' for an explanation  of  the
difference between your 'working' and your 'true' bmap.

When  sectors owned by you get transferred to your friend's bmap, they will be
replaced with the first letter of your country name  (capitalized),  the  only
exception  being  harbors and bridges which will always be transmitted.  Also,
if you want to send them the location of owned sectors having a certain desig-
nation you can specify that using the optional <des> argument.  For example if
your country name was "TheScum" and you typed:
   [##:##] Command : sharebmap Fodderland #1 j
then all of your bmap would be added to Fodderland's bmap, with sectors  owned
by  you  replaced  with  'T',  except for your '=', 'h', and 'j' sectors which
would be sent as is.

Note that the destination bmap will only be changed if in that location  there
was  a  '?',  a '.', a ' ', or the first letter of your country name (capital-
ized).  Thus, the receiving country will not  lose  any  information  in  this
exchange.

Note  that  the  sharebmap command only changes your 'working' bmap and so you
can delete sharebmap information from your bmap by typing:
   [##:##] Command : bmap <SECTS> revert
