                               Command : SSTAT

NAME
   sstat - Report statistics of ship, fleet or ships in a given area

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : sstat [<SHIP/FLEET> | <SECTS>]

The  sstat  command  is  a  report of the varying statistics of your ships and
lists the info in a readable format.  Since your  ships'  statistics  vary  by
tech  level,  this  is a very useful way to see what the attack, defense, etc.
modifiers are on a per-ship basis.

The <SHIP/FLEET> and <SECTS> arguments are provided in case you only  wish  to
look at one ship or one fleet or all ships within a given area.

Sstat  expects  an  argument.  To see every ship you own, give it the argument
'*', or type "sstat *".

The report format contains the following fields:

     shp#  the ship number
ship-type  the type of ship; "patrol boat", "submarine", etc,
      x,y  the ship's current location (relative to your capital),
      eff  the ship's efficiency,
     tech  the tech level of the ship
      def  the armor value of the ship (i.e. how strong is the hull)
      spd  the speed of the ship
      vis  the visibility of the ship (i.e. how easy is it to see)
      rng  twice the distance the guns can fire, The range formula is  (rng/2)
           * ((tech + 50) / (tech + 200))
      fir  the number of guns the ship can fire at once

For example:
   [##:##] Command : ship *

   shp# ship-type                 x,y    eff  tech def spd vis rng fir
      0 dd  destroyer             1,1    100%  140  51  41  19   9   2
