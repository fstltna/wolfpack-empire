SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : set <TYPE> <SHIPS|PLANES|UNITS|NUKES> <PRICE>

The  set  price  command  allows  you to set the prices on ships, planes, land
units or nukes for sale.

<TYPE> is the type of unit you are putting on sale,  either  ship,  plane,  or
land  or  nuke.  <SHIPS|PLANES|UNITS|NUKES> is(are) the unit #(s), and <PRICE>
is the cost per item.

If you don't supply the price on the command line the  program  will  ask  the
selling price.

Negative prices can't be used (no more Crazy Eddie).

You may withdraw an offer by setting the price to zero.

Note  that  ships are not "delivered" to the purchaser, but planes, land units
and nukes are.
