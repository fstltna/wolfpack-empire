                             Command : COASTWATCH

NAME
   coastwatch - Check from sectors for nearby ships

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : coastwatch [<SECTS>]

The coastwatch command allows coastal sectors to report sightings of ships.

Visibility  range  is equal to four times the sector efficiency expressed as a
decimal times the technology factor; e.g. a 100% efficient harbor with  a  50%
technology  factor  can  see  2 sectors away.  An exception is radar installa-
tions, which have a maximum range equal to fourteen  times  the  sector  effi-
ciency, (i.e. 3.5 times as far).

A typical usage might be:
   [##:##] Command : coast #3 ?type=)

     3,-11 efficiency 100%, range 5.6
   Pandora (#5) oil derrick #74 @3, -9
    -1,4   efficiency 100%, range 5.6
    -3,13  efficiency 100%, range 5.6
   Galexis (#2) destroyer #35 @-3, 11

Note that subs will NOT show up on coastwatch, unless they are in a sector you
own.
