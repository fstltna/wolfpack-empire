                                    BASICS

SEA  -  Sea sectors form natural barriers that can only be crossed by ships or
spanned by bridges.  You can't designate anything else to be sea, nor can  sea
be designated to be anything else.

MOUNTAIN - Mountain sectors form another natural barrier that cannot be redes-
ignated; however, they can be moved through, at  great  expense  in  terms  of
mobility.   In  a pinch, mountains can be used as capital.  They generate very
few BTUs, and represent being 'holed up in the mountains', perhaps like Pancho
Villa.   Mountains  typically  hold only 1/10th of the civilians and uncompen-
sated workers that other sectors do.

SANCTUARY - Sanctuary sectors are created when a new nation is created.   They
are  inviolate  in  that no one can attack or harm them.  This protection ends
when the new country first moves out of the sanctuary.  This is called "break-
ing sanctuary".  See "info break" for details.

WASTELAND  -  This is the result of the explosion of a nuclear device.  Waste-
lands are uninhabitable forever.

WILDERNESS - Most of the world is wilderness at the  beginning  of  the  game.
Wilderness  has  no particular attributes; you will probably want to designate
it as something else once you own it.

PLAINS - Plains sectors form another natural barrier that cannot  be  redesig-
nated.  They can be occupied and moved through however.  Plains typically hold
only 1/10th of the civilians and uncompensated workers that other sectors do.

CAPITAL/CITY - These sectors can serve as your capital.  You'll be quite help-
less  without a capital, as many commands require you to have one.  Your capi-
tal is also your source of bureaucratic time units (BTUs), see "info BTU".   A
nation  may  only have one active capital at a time, although many sectors may
be designated as capitals.  Use the capital command  to  make  a  capital  the
active  one.   The capture of a capital has disastrous consequences, which are
described in "info capital ".  Capitals  are  typically  better  at  defending
against attack than other sectors, except fortresses.

PARK  -  Parks  are  provided solely for the convenience of the people.  Parks
require construction materials to provide maintenance services and  add  to  a
nation's "happiness" level.

                                COMMUNICATIONS

HIGHWAY  -  Moving  stuff through sectors costs mobility.  Efficienct highways
cost much less than other sectors.  To find out more about moving stuff, start
with "info Transportation".

RADAR  -  Radar  stations  can scan the surrounding area, and generate a radar
plot identifying sector types at distances up to 1/3 their range and ships  up
to a distance depending on ship visibility.

BRIDGE  HEAD  - Bridge heads are the land based ends of bridges.  They let you
build bridge spans; see "info build"  for  how.   If  option  EASY_BRIDGES  is
enabled, any sector can build bridges, not just bridge heads.

BRIDGE  SPAN  -  A  bridge span is the suspended part of a bridge that crosses
water sectors.  Bridge spans are built and supported by bridge heads  and  are
much like highways except for two things:
(1) Bridge spans must maintain at least 20% efficiency or else they collapse.
(2)  If  the  only bridge head supporting a particular bridge span is redesig-
nated as  something  else,  the  bridge  span  will  collapse,  unless  option
EASY_BRIDGES is enabled.

BRIDGE  TOWER  -  Bridge towers are like bridge heads you can build out in the
ocean.  They are only available if option BRIDGETOWERS is enabled.  You  build
bridge  towers from a bridge span into open water, not adjacent to any land or
other bridge towers.  From a bridge tower, you can build other  bridge  spans.
Bridge towers must maintain at least 20% efficiency or else they collapse.

                                  FINANCIAL

BANK  -  Banks  are  used  for smelting and storing gold bars.  They include a
smelter to refine gold dust into gold bars.  While the bars are stored in  the
bank  the  busy  little  bankers invest them and return a profit on their use.
Banks are of the Fort Knox variety; they are more impervious to shelling  than
most  other sectors, and military in them fight harder against attack as those
in industries.  Banks are also particularly adept at moving gold bars  around;
fewer  mobility units are required to move a gold bar from a bank than from an
ordinary sector.

                                  INDUSTRIES

DEFENSE - Defense plants turn construction  materials  into  guns.   Guns  are
required to equip fortresses, warships, some land units and for sector flak.

SHELL  INDUSTRY  -  These  sectors are similar to defense plant sectors except
they turn construction materials into shells.  Most of anything that goes boom
expends shells in the process.

MINE  -  Mines  produce  iron  ore  by  digging it out of the ground.  Iron is
required to make construction materials.

GOLD MINE - Gold mines are similar to ordinary mines, except that they produce
gold  dust.   Gold  dust is required to make gold bars, which are an important
source of income.

URANIUM MINE - Uranium mines are very similar to gold mines, except that  they
produce radioactive materials.

HARBOR  -  Harbors  combine  shipyard facilities and docks.  This is where you
build ships; see "info build" for how.  Harbors also repair incomplete or dam-
aged  ships,  provided there's enough work and materials.  Harbors are good at
moving commodities, and are often used as distribution centers.

WAREHOUSE - Warehouses are used to store commodities.  They are good at moving
commodities, and are often used as distribution centers.

AIRFIELD - This is where you build planes; see "info build" for how.  Airfield
also repair incomplete or damaged planes, provided  there's  enough  work  and
materials.   Planes can take off and land at airfields.  Some can take off and
land in other sectors as well, and some  can  also  use  carriers;  see  "info
Plane-types" for details.

AGRIBUSINESS  -  These sectors are large farms and provide food.  Agribusiness
sectors produce much more food than other sectors.

OIL - Oil fields produce oil by pumping it out of the ground.

REFINERY - Refineries produce petroleum by processing oil.

LIGHT - Light manufacturing plants produce light construction  materials  from
iron.

HEAVY  -  Heavy manufacturing plants produce heavy construction materials from
iron.

                            MILITARY / SCIENTIFIC

FORTRESS - Fortresses are military strongpoints, resistant to attack, adept at
counter-attack.   They  can fire guns (unless option NO_FORT_FIRE is enabled),
and they repair damaged land units, provided there's enough work  and  materi-
als.

TECHNOLOGY  -  Technical  centers  are bastions of "pure" technology research,
which is to say universities with massive  defense  department  grants.   They
turn  construction  materials  into technological advances thereby raising the
technology level of the country (which affects gun ranges, pollution, etc.).

RESEARCH - The research lab is a bastion of "pure" medical research, which  is
to  say  it  is  a  large university with massive March-of-Dimes funding.  The
research lab turns construction materials into medical discoveries which raise
the  research level of the country and help retard the spread of disease (usu-
ally caused by the pollution from technical centers).

NUCLEAR - The nuclear lab is a bastion of applied technology, which is to  say
it is an immense underground building filled with evil geniuses playing Adven-
ture on huge computers.  You can build nuclear weapons here; see "info  build"
for how.

LIBRARY/SCHOOL  -  The  library/school sector is the foundation of a country's
educational structure.  It uses up construction materials to produce units  of
education  which  raise  the  educational  level of the country, which in turn
affects the efficiency of research and technology sectors.

ENLISTMENT - The enlistment sector is the boot camp of  Empire.   It  converts
civilians into military.  Unlike the other production sectors, it can use only
military as workforce for that.

HEADQUARTERS - This is where you build land units; see "info build"  for  how.
Headquarters  also  repair  incomplete or damaged land units, provided there's
enough work and materials.  They also give a  bonus  to  reaction  radius  for
units deployed there, allowing them to defend better.

Production takes place automatically at the update, at a rate dependent on the
efficiency of the sector, your production efficiency  for  that  product,  the
presence  of  the required materials, and the number of workers in the sector.
"info Products" has more.

The "show" command can be used to show special things about sector types.   To
check out build costs, you do:
   [##:##] Command : show sect build

                             build 100% eff  maint
   sector type               lcm  hcm     $      $

   any other                   0    0   100      0

   Infrastructure building - adding 1 point of efficiency costs:
          type          lcms    hcms    mobility    $$$$
   road network            2       2           1       2

   defense factor          1       1           1       1

build lcm  The lcm required to build the sector.
build hcm  The hcm required to build the sector.
  build $  What it costs to build the sector.
  maint $  Cost of maintenance per update.

The  show  command  also  shows infrastructure build costs.  Infrastructure is
additional facilities you can build up in your sectors.  See "info Infrastruc-
ture" for details.

The  two  mob cost columns show the relative cost to move through such sectors
at 0% and 100% efficiency.  It changes linearly between 0% and 100%.

Combat strength is multiplied by sector offensive factor on attack and  defen-
sive  factor  on  defense.   Columns  max off and def show them for 100% effi-
ciency.  They're always 1 for 0%, except for mountains, where the 0% defensive
factor is 2.  Both factors change linearly between 0% and 100%.

Some  sector  types are more adept at moving certain commodities: the mobility
cost is divided by a packing bonus.

Column max pop shows how many civilians and uncompensated workers  the  sector
type can hold.

Finally, to check out what sectors can do, use:
   [##:##] Command : show sect capabilities

Column  product  shows what the sector produces.  Column p.e. shows the sector
type's process efficiency.  Use command "show product" to find out more  about
products, and see "info Products".

Column capabilities shows special capabilities, if any.  These are:

deity  Can only be designated by a deity.
