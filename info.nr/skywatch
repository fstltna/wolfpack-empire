SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : skywatch [<SECTS>]

The skywatch command allows sectors to report sightings of satellites.

The visibility range is equal to four times the sector efficiency expressed as
a decimal times the technology factor; e.g. a 100% efficient mine with  a  50%
technology  factor  can  see  2 sectors away.  An exception is radar installa-
tions, which have a maximum range equal to fourteen  times  the  sector  effi-
ciency, (i.e. 3.5 times as far).
