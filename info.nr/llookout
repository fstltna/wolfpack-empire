                              Command : LLOOKOUT

NAME
   llookout - Check from units for other units, planes and/or sector types

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : lookout <UNIT/ARMY>

The  lookout  command allows units to report sightings of other units, planes,
and land sectors.

Note that non-spy units require military on-board in order to be able  to  see
anything.

The various ranges over which lookout is effective break down into two groups:

UNIT to UNIT

  This  range  is  dependent on both the visibility of the unit being observed
  and the visual range of the observing unit.  (see "info Unit-types")

UNIT to PLANE

  Planes are treated as if they had a visibility of 10.

For example:
   [##:##] Command : lookout 24

   Groonland (#2) jf4 jet fighter 4 #3 @2,-2
   Groonland (#2) airfield 100% efficient with approx 50 civ @ 2,-2
   Groonland (#2) highway 20% efficient with approx 20 civ @ 3,-1
   Groonland (#2) highway 0% efficient with approx 0 civ @ 0,-2
