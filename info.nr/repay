SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : repay <LOAN>

The repay command is used to repay loans from other countries.

The  <LOAN> argument is the number of the loan you are repaying and if not in-
cluded on the command line it will be solicited by the program.

You can repay all or part of the loan with this  command;  however  beware  of
letting  the  loan become overdue -- the lender may decide to force collection
(see "info collect").

When you repay on a loan a telegram is sent to the lender informing her/him of
the amount repaid.
