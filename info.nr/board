                               Command : BOARD

NAME
   board - Board enemy ship

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : board [<VICTIM SHIP>] [<FROM SHIP> | <FROM SECT>]

The  board  command enables two ships' crews to engage in hand-to-hand combat.
To board ship #16 from ship #93 you might type:
   [##:##] Command : board 16

The program will ask from which ship or sector you wish to board, (you may on-
ly  board  from  one ship at a time), how many troops to board with, and which
land units (having "assault" capability) to board with.

In order to be able to board a ship from a ship, your ship must be as fast  or
faster than the defending ship.  If you can't catch him, you can't board him!

The  attacking  ship  will use, based upon its speed, an amount of mobility to
overtake and board the target ship.  If the attacking ship has no mobility, it
cannot  catch  anybody!   Ships' speed depends upon the speed of the ship, the
technology of the owner, and the current efficiency of the ship.  A  50%  dam-
aged ship moves one-half the speed it does when undamaged.

In  order  to  board a ship from a sector, the ship must be in the sector, and
either the sector must have mobility or it must contain some land  units  with
the "assault" capability.

Some things to note:

The  defense  strength  is  multiplied by 1 + def/100 where def is the defense
strength of the ship (see show ship stats).

Other ships belonging to the victim will fire on you when you  try  to  board,
(if you're within range).

Any  land units in the combat will fight as if they were simply mil, i.e. they
won't get any offensive of defensive multiplier,  except  for  "marine"  units
which  get  their  full  bonus.   Similarly, units on ships don't have to take
morale checks, as they are fighting as mil.  Mil on the victim ship will still
die before units take casualties, however.

Note that you can only board with as many mil and land units that the ship you
are trying to board can hold.

See info "Attacking" for the exact procedure.
