                                Command : STOP

NAME
   stop - Stop production and repairs

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : stop <TYPE> <SECTS|SHIPS|PLANES|UNITS|NUKES>

The stop command stops production and repairs for one update.

Stopped  sectors don't gain efficiency, don't produce anything, and don't work
on ships, planes or units there, but otherwise function normally:  they  still
pay tax, distribute goods and so forth.

Stopping  ships,  planes  and  land units works just the same: they don't gain
efficiency, they don't produce anything (if applicable), and they  don't  work
on embarked land units or planes.

Stopping nukes doesn't do anything in particular, right now.

Conquering  a  sector,  ship, plane, land unit or nuke stops it automatically.
Stop orders expire at the update.  Use the start command to  countermand  them
manually.
