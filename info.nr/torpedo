                              Command : TORPEDO

NAME
   torpedo - Slip a torpedo to some poor sucker (from a sub or ship)

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : torpedo <submarine-SHIPS> <target-SHIP>

The torpedo command is used to shoot other naval vessels in a sneaky manner.

The <target-SHIP> argument is the victim ship number and the <submarine-SHIPS>
argument is the number(s) of your submarine  or  other  ship(s)  with  torpedo
ability.  The program will ask for these if not provided on the command line.

Your <submarine-SHIPS> must meet the following criteria:
   1) It must have torpedo ability. (see info show)
   2) It must have at least 1 gun (torpedo tube)
   3) It must have at least 3 shells (3 shells = 1 torpedo)
   4) It must be at least 60% efficient
   5) It must have some mobility
Meeting  all  these  criteria, your torpedo will be launched toward the victim
ship and a countdown of seconds until the expected detonation will commence.

The range of a torpedo depends on the type of sub, and its  tech  level.  Cur-
rently the range formula looks like this:
        (frng) * (tech+50)/(tech+200)

        [Note: frng comes from show ship capability]

If  the target is out of range, you will be told so, (after your torpedo is in
the water).  See "info Hitchance" for the chance of a torpedo hitting its tar-
get.

If  the target ship is not in a direct line of sight but in range, the torpedo
will slam into land and you will be notified.  Note that the victim ship  will
still see the torpedo being launched and can return a depth charge attack (see
below.)

A hit will be reported to you as "BOOM!", See "info  Damage"  for  the  damage
that a torpedo does.

In  order  to simulate the "real-time" situation, your mobility will be decre-
mented by mobility equal to 1/2 the cost the torpedo-ship would pay to move  a
sector  for  each  torpedo  fired;  if it goes to zero (or beyond) you will be
forced to stick around.

Victims of submarine torpedoes get only told that a  submarine  attacked,  not
which one (so you can deny it).

The victim's only automatic protection against sub attacks is that any ship of
his/hers that is capable of retaliating with depth charges or  torpedoes  will
do so.  This will reveal number and position of your submarine.

Against  surface  ships launching torpedo attacks, the victim gets to fire all
his ships & sectors within range at the attackers BEFORE the attackers get  to
fire.  Damage done by all defending ships is divided evenly over all attacking
ships.
