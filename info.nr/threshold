                             Command : THRESHOLD

NAME
   threshold - Set commodity distribution thresholds

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : threshold <ITEM> <SECTS> <THRESH>

The  threshold command is used to specify the level of a given commodity which
is to be maintained by the sector's distribution  sector.   These  levels  are
maintained by either importing or exporting commodities.  This importation and
exportation is done automatically during an update.  It uses much less  mobil-
ity than manual moves.  See "info Mobility" for details.

In  the syntax, <SECTS> is the sector or sectors from which the deliveries are
made, <ITEM> is one of the following:

   c       civilians
   m       military
   u       uncompensated workers
   f       food
   s       shells
   g       guns
   p       planes
   i       iron ore
   d       gold dust
   b       bars of gold
   o       oil
   l       light construction materials
   h       heavy construction materials
   r       radioactive materials

and <THRESH> is a number specifying the level of commodity which is desired.

The census and commodity reports will indicate distribution thresholds by  the
"hundreds  digit"  of  the threshold level.  In order to have a threshold take
effect, it must be at least one.

Sectors importing or exporting items  can  be  seen  by  the  "route"  command
(marked with a "$") or by the sect command.

Also, note that no distribution center will ship out its last civilian.
