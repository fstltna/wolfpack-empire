NAME
   morale - Change the retreat percentage of a unit

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : morale <UNITS> <retreat percentage>

The "morale" command is used to set the retreat percentage of land units.

Whenever  a  land  unit takes a hit in combat, it may break off combat and at-
tempt to retreat.  This is called "failing a morale check".  The chance for it
to happen is unit's retreat percentage - efficiency.

The  morale  command  allows you to adjust this percentage within a range. If,
for example, you wish only to trade space for time, you could set the  retreat
percentage  to  100%,  meaning  that your units would retreat often, but would
still slow the enemy down a bit. Or, you could set your retreat percentage  to
the minimum, and make the unit stick around and fight more, but at the cost of
more casualties.

The maximum allowed value is 100%.  The minimum value is based on happiness:
   (morale_base) - happiness

"morale_base" is a deity settable variable, which defaults to 42.  When a unit
is first built, its retreat percentage is set to "morale_base".
