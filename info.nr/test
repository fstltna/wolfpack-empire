                                Command : TEST

NAME
   test - Check the effect of a proposed move

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : test <ITEM> <SECT> <NUMBER> <ROUTE|DESTINATION>

The  test  command  lets you check the effect of a proposed move.  This can be
helpful when you're not sure whether you have enough mobility to reach a  cer-
tain location or you wish to compare two possible routes for a move.

The  test  command has exactly the same arguments as the move command and acts
almost the same.  There are two important differences:

   Nothing is actually moved and no mobility is used.

   The move is tested for <NUMBER> <ITEM> irrespective of how much  <ITEM>  is
   actually  in the sector.  This is useful for testing a sector which will be
   used as a temporary stopover in a multi-step move to make  sure  the  stuff
   won't get stranded there.
