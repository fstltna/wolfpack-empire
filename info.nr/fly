SYNTAX
   [##:##]  Command  :  fly  <TRANSPORTS>  <ESCORTS> <SECT> <PATH|DESTINATION>
<COMMODITY>

The "fly" command is used to move planes and  commodities  from  the  starting
sector(s), and ending up in the target sector.

<TRANSPORTS>  represents  a  list  of planes which are to travel to the target
sector.  Only planes with sufficient mobility, based in a sector stocked  with
petrol and the commodities to transport, will be successfully selected for the
mission.

<ESCORTS> represent a list of fighter planes which are  capable  of  escorting
the  transports  all the way to the target.  To be selected, escorts must have
fuel and mobility.

<SECT> represents an assembly point, where all of the planes  in  the  mission
meet  before  proceeding  on to the target sector.  The assembly point must be
owned by you or an ally, or you or an ally must have a ship  there.   It  must
not  be  more  than  four sectors away from any of the planes selected for the
mission.

<COMMODITY> is the name of a commodity which is to be carried along on all  of
the  planes  which  have  a transport capacity.  If nothing is specified, then
nothing will be carried.

Route is a normal empire path specification. You may also give  a  destination
sector  on the command line, or at any time while giving the route, and empire
will use the best path from the current sector to the desired destination sec-
tor.

When  getting  a  path interactively, empire will show you the information you
have (from your bmap) concerning the current  area,  to  help  you  plot  your
course.

Transport  missions  can be intercepted just like any other mission.  See info
"Intercept".

If the destination sector is not an airport, then all planes  in  the  mission
must have VTOL capability.

Note  that  a  plane  must  be  at least 40% efficient before it can leave the
ground.
