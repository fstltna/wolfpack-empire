SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : scuttle <s|l|p> <SHIPS | UNITS | PLANES>

This  command allows you to destroy planes/units/ships when you no longer need
them.

Planes, units, and ships may be scuttled in any sector.

If you scuttle a ship or unit that has planes on board, the planes will either
be transferred to land (if a unit, or if the ship is in a harbor), or will die
(if the ship is elsewhere)

Units on ships may not be scuttled.

Scuttling trade-ships has other effects.  See info Trade-ships.
