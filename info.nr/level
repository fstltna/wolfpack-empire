   level - List distribution thresholds

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : level <SECTS>

The  level  report provides information about the various distribution thresh-
olds in some or all of the sectors that you occupy.

In the syntax of the level command <SECTS> is the area on which you  wish  in-
formation, (see "info syntax").  A typical usage might be:
   [##:##] Command : level -6:6,-3:3
which  would list data for the area extending three sectors out from the capi-
tal in each direction.

The level report lists each of your sectors with the following heading:
