Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : offer loan <CNUM/CNAME> <AMOUNT> <DURATION> <RATE>

The offer command is used to offer a loan to another country.

<CNUM/CNAME> is the number or name of the country to whom you are offering the
loan,

<AMOUNT> is the size of the loan.  (NOTE: do not use a dollar sign),

<DURATION> is the length of the loan in days,

<RATE> is the interest rate, (per <DURATION>), on the loan.

The program prompts with various questions concerning any terms  of  the  loan
not provided on the command line and sends a telegram to <CNUM/CNAME> announc-
ing the loan offer.

If the other country accepts the loan, (using  the  "consider"  command),  the
money  will be transferred from your account and you will be notified that the
loan duration has started.

Note that the dependence of rate on the duration makes a 30 day loan at 10%  a
worse deal than a 60 day loan at 15%.
