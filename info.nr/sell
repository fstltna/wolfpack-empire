SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : sell <COMMODITY> <SECT> <AMOUNT> <PRICE>

The  sell  command allows nations to sell commodities on the open market.  Not
all commodities can be traded -- notably civilians and military.

The <COMMODITY> is the type of commodity you are  selling,  <SECT>  represents
the sector which will be selling items.  Only harbors and warehouses which are
at least 60% efficient may sell goods.

<AMOUNT>, if positive, reflects the amount of food to be taken from each  sec-
tor.   If  negative, the amount shows the "lower limit" of food required to be
present in that sector and will only  sell  food  in  excess  of  that  limit.
<PRICE> is the base price of the commodity per unit to the world.

In  addition,  the  sector  selling  needs to have at least 1 mobility to sell
goods.

Typical output looks like:

   [7:640] Command : sell food 4,-2 10 5
   Sold 10 food at 4,-2 (206 left)

   [7:639] Command : sell food 4,-2 -100 5
   Sold 106 food at 4,-2 (100 left)

Only harbors and warehouses may sell items.  Also, note that due to  the  time
delay market, you don't get any money until the goods are actually bidded upon
and paid for once the bidding time is up.

There is a certain overhead on selling items, based on the difficulty of  mov-
ing  the  items in question.  This is based on the tax you pay which is set by
the deity (see "info version").
