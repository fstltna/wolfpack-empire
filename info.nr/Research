                              Concept : Research

NAME
   Research - How Research level is calculated each update

Level: Expert

If  the  RES_POP  option is in use, the research level of a country determines
the maximum number of civilians and uw's that can live in a sector. For  ordi-
nary sectors, the maximum is:

   min(1000, 400 + 600 * ((research*4 + 50)/(research*3 + 200)))

So,  for  example, at 0 research, after an update, the max you could have in a
sector would be 550 civs and 550 uws.  Note that in the case of captured  sec-
tors,  the  research level of the current owner governs, even if the old owner
of the sector had a higher/lower research.

If, after population growth, there are more civs than the  limit,  the  excess
are lost.  Uw's work the same way.

The  research  level also affects the likelihood of plague outbreaks.  (Unless
the NO_PLAGUE option is used, of course)

The "nation" command will display, among other things, your  current  research
level.

The procedure determining how much your research level goes up every update is
exactly the same for research as it is for technology (see "info  Technology")
except  for  the  fact  that  "research log base" is always 2.00 and "easy re-
search" is always 0.75.  But besides this, research bleeds, decays, and  leaks
in exactly the same way as technology.
