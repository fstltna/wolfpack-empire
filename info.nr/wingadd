                              Command : WINGADD

NAME
   wingadd - Designate members of a "wing"

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : wingadd <WING> <PLANE/WING>

The wingadd command is used to specify the wing groupings of your planes.

   [##:##] Command : wingadd <WING> <PLANE/WING>
In the syntax <WING> is the alphabetic character to be used as the wing desig-
nation.  This character can be chosen from the set of upper or lower case  a-z
and  tilde  (~).  The pseudo-wing specification tilde specifies all planes not
currently in any wing.

The specification of planes, <PLANE/WING>, can have one of several syntaxes:

   example     meaning
   -------     -------
   23          plane 23
   2/14/23     planes 2, 14, and 23
   c           all planes currently in wing `c'
   ~           all planes currently in the "null" wing
   2,3         all planes in sector 2,3
   -1:3,0:2    all planes in the square area bounded by -1,0 & 3,2

All wings, (with the exception of the `~' wing), are limited to  some  maximum
size  and  you will be informed how many planes can be added when this command
is run.

Having planes organized into wings can be very  helpful  in  loading,  moving,
etc.,  in that fewer commands are required to perform these commands on groups
of planes if they can be specified by wing number.

Note that you can remove planes from a wing by adding them to  the  `~'  wing.
e.g.
   [##:##] Command : wingadd ~ A
This command would purge all planes from wing `A'.
