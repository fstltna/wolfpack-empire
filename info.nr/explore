                              Command : EXPLORE

NAME
   explore - Claim unowned land

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : explore <ITEM> <SECT> <NUMBER> <ROUTE|DESTINATION>

The  explore command takes over part of the functionality of move.  Explore is
used to stake your claim to unowned sectors.  Only civilians and military  can
be used to explore.

<ITEM> can be any one of:

   c       civilians
   m       military

If  <SECT>  is  not provided in the command line, the program will request the
starting sector then display the resources of that sector and a map of the ad-
joining  sectors.  The prompt consists of the number of mobility units in that
sector, its designation, and its coordinates in the form:

   <97.0: a -6,4>

which indicates 97 mobility units in agribusiness sector -6,4.   You  may  re-
spond with any combination of:

   y  for up-left
   u  for up-right               y    u
   g  for left                    \  /
   j  for right               g  --  --  j
   b  for down-left               /  \
   n  for down-right             b    n
   v  for view
   m  for map
   h  for end of movement

The "view" command shows the sector efficiency and some of the contents of the
sector you are currently occupying.

Since the <ROUTE> can be specified in the command line, simple  movements  are
often typed as a single line, such as:
   [##:##] Command : explore m 2,0 20 jjjh
Or  some  movements may be done partly on the command line and partly interac-
tively:
   [##:##] Command : explore c 2,0 1 gg

       - ^         min gold fert  oil uran
      - - +         67    0    0    0   82
       - ^
   <125.4: - -4,0> v
   0% wilderness with 0 civilians.
       - ^         min gold fert  oil uran
      - - +         67    0    0    0   82
       - ^
   <125.4: - -4,0> h
   Sector -4,0 is now yours.

You may also simply specify the destination sector on  the  command  line.  In
this  case,  empire will set the path to be the cheapest path (in terms of mo-
bility) from the current sector to the destination sector, if such a path  ex-
ists.  However,  the best path cannot extend out of your owned sectors, so the
best use for this feature is to use it to get to the edge of your owned terri-
tory, and then explore manually from there.

For example,
   [##:##] Command : explore 2,0 1 -2,0

       ^ -         min gold fert  oil uran
      - + c         67    0    0    0   82
       ^ -
   <126.2: - -2,0> g
       - ^         min gold fert  oil uran
      - - +         67    0    0    0   82
       - ^
   <125.4: - -4,0> h
   Sector -4,0 is now yours.

The  "map"  command will give you a map surrounding the current position.  You
can also supply additional parameters:
   [##:##] Command : <32.3: g 6,2> m # ls

is equivalent to a "map" command, like this:
   [##:##] Command : map # ls

See "info Mobility" for a description of how much mobility it costs to explore
into sectors.

Note  that  while exploring, you might hit mines. The more civs or mil you ex-
plore with, the greater the chance of setting off any mines in the sectors you
move through. See info lmine for details.
