                               Command : PAYOFF

NAME
   payoff - Find out the current payoff of a trade ship

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : payoff [<SHIP/FLEET> | <SECTS>]

The  payoff  command  gives a census of your trade ships, and lists the payoff
they would give if scuttled at the current sector.  Payoff can only be  calcu-
lated  for  trade  ships you built yourself, not for ships you `acquired' from
somebody else.

The <SHIP/FLEET> and <SECTS> arguments are provided in case you only  wish  to
look at one ship or one fleet or all ships within a given area.

Payoff  expects  an  argument.   To  see every trade ship you own, give it the
argument '*', or type "ship *".

The report format contains the following fields:

    shp#  the ship number
shiptype  the type of ship; "patrol boat", "submarine", etc,
     x,y  the ship's current location (relative to your capital),
      $$  the money you would get if you scuttled this ship

For example:
   [##:##] Command : payoff *

   shp#     ship type  orig x,y       x,y    dist $$
