NAME
   wall - Send a message directly to all allies terminals

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : wall [<MESSAGE>]

The  wall command allows instant communication between allied nations.  It may
be called in two different ways.  You can either send your  ally  a  one  line
message as in:
   [##:##] Command : wall Hi there, I'm back from lunch

Or you can send a multi-line message:
   [##:##] Command : wall

   > Everyone ready?
   > OK, let's hit the beaches!
   > .

You can end a multi-line flash with a '.' (period) on a line all by itself.

If  you  do  not wish to receive any broadcast messages from your allies, then
you can temporarily turn the feature off by typing "toggle flash".
