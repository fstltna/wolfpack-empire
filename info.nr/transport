                             Command : TRANSPORT

NAME
   transport - Move planes or nuclear devices around

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : transport plane <PLANES> <ROUTE|DESTINATION>

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : transport nuke <NUKES> <ROUTE|DESTINATION>

The transport command is used to move planes and nuclear devices from one sec-
tor to another, along the ground.

<ROUTE> is a normal empire path specification. You may also give  a  <DESTINA-
TION>  sector  on the command line, or at any time while giving the route, and
empire will use the cheapest path (in terms of mobility) from the current sec-
tor to the destination sector.

You would move nuke #666 to 8,0 as follows:
   [##:##] Command : transport nuke 666 8,0

You could move all planes in wing d to -6,0 as follows:
   [##:##] Command : transport plane d -6,0

The  "map"  command will give you a map surrounding the current position.  You
can also supply additional parameters:
   [##:##] Command : <32.3: g 6,2> m 3 ls

is equivalent to a "pmap" command when transporting planes, like this:
   [##:##] Command : pmap 3 ls

or it is equivalent to a "nmap" command when transporting nukes.

Note that while transporting, you may run into any  landmines  the  enemy  has
left  in  your  sectors.  In that case, the planes being transported will take
damage. See info "lmine" for details.

Also, if your enemy has any units on interdiction  mission,  then  the  planes
you're transporting may get hit by them.

Nuclear  warheads  are transported in heavily armoured vehicles and are immune
to land mines and interdiction.

See info "Mobility" for the mobility cost to transport planes and nukes.
