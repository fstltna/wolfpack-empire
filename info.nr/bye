SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : bye

The bye command is how you go "bye-bye" to log out of the game.

This command costs zero BTUs.  You can use it often.

If,  for some obscure reason, you would like to end an Empire session but pre-
fer not to use the "bye" command you may achieve the same result by typing the
EOT character, (control-D).
