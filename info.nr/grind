SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : grind <SECTS> <NUMBER>

The  "grind" command converts gold bars back into dust.  This costs 1 BTU plus
5 "available work units" per bar and can be done in any  sector  which  is  at
least  60%  efficient.   Due to inefficiencies in the conversion process, only
80% of the dust can be recovered.
