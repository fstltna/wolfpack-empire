An  example of using deliver in addition to distribute is where you may have a
mine which uses distribute to get its food from a warehouse, but uses  deliver
to export its iron to the adjacent hcm factory.

Deliver  may  be  used  to  extra-fine  tune a distribution network.  In fact,
deliver can greatly improve the performance of a distribution network if  used
properly.

If  'q' is specified rather than a threshold, then the delivery directions and
thresholds will simply be listed.  You can also use the  "cutoff"  command  to
list delivery thresholds.

The  number <THRESH> specifies how much of that commodity you would like to be
kept in the sector.  If you do not want to change the direction that a  sector
delivers to, then put a '+' before the number <THRESH>.

Note  that delivery thresholds are stored as multiples of 8.  If you specify a
threshold that is not a multiple of 8, it will be rounded down.

Delivery will not ship out the last civilian or the last military if there are
no civilians, regardless of thresholds.

The  direction must be specified as one of the six direction characters, (usu-
ally `y' `u' `j' `n' `b' or `g'), the "no-direction" character, (usually `h').
If  no direction is specified, then the direction will not be changed for that
sector.

   [##:##] Command : deli f 0,0 0 j
Will deliver all food from 0,0 to 2,0.
   [##:##] Command : deli i * ?des=m +87
Will set iron delivery threshold to 80 in all mines.
   [##:##] Command : deli l * q
Will list all lcm delivery specifications.  (Sectors with no delivery  thresh-
old or direction will not be listed).

The  census and commodity reports will indicate deliveries by the same charac-
ters used to specify them in this command.

If, during an update, the destination sector is not owned by you, the  message
"delivery  walkout  between  x,y  &  x,y"  will be printed and nothing will be
delivered.

Delivery routes may also be mapped out with the "route" command.
