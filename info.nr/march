                               Command : MARCH

NAME
   march - Move a land unit or units

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : march <LAND UNIT/ARMY> <ROUTE|DESTINATION>

The  march  command is the "move" command applied to land units.  You can con-
trol one unit or an entire army with it, but they must all start in  the  same
sector.

Land  units  may  only move into sectors you own, sectors of countries you are
allied with or deity-owned sectors with 1 exception.  Spies.  Spies  may  move
anywhere, with a chance of getting caught.  See "info Spies" for more informa-
tion.

The program will prompt with the maximum and  minimum  mobility  of  the  land
units in the army, and its current position in the form:

   <57.0:23.5: -6,4>

which means the land units have between 23.5 and 57 mobility units, and are in
sector -6,4.  You may indicate the direction you would like the army  to  move
by typing a string of letters consisting of any combination of the following:

   y  for up-left
   u  for up-right               y    u
   g  for left                    \  /
   j  for right               g  --  --  j
   b  for down-left               /  \
   n  for down-right             b    n

Other commands you may type while navigating are:

   M  for map
   B  for bmap
   f  to change the leader
   i  to list land units you are marching
   r  for radar
   l  for lookout
   m  to sweep landmines
   d  to drop landmines
   h  for end of movement

The  "radar"  command will cause the lead unit to use it's radar, if any.  You
may also give a unit number or army or group of units on  the  same  line:  "r
12/13/14/73"

The lookout command works in the same way as radar.

The  "map"  command  will give you a map surrounding the current position.  By
default, it will be around the leader.  You can also supply additional parame-
ters:
   [##:##] Command : <32.3: g 6,2> M 3 ls

is equivalent to a "lmap" command. like this:
   [##:##] Command : lmap 3 ls
The  "bmap"  command works in the same way, it is equivalent to a "lbmap" com-
mand.

The "leader" command will the change the leader.  By default, it  will  select
next unit in the list, but you may also specify a land unit.

The  "drop"  command will lay land mines using engineers.  You can specify the
unit number or army or groups of units and the number of  land  mines  on  the
same  line:  "d 12/13 10".  An omitted unit number defaults to the leader, for
example "d 10" lays ten land mines from the leader.  If you omit the number of
land mines as well, the leader will lay one mine.

The  "sweep"  command will have the engineers in the marching group search for
mines in the current sector.  This costs as much mobility as entering a sector
with mobility cost of 0.2.

Note:  the  lookout, radar, drop and sweep commands use BTUs, just as if you'd
typed them separately from the command line.

Since the <ROUTE> can be specified in the command line, simple unit  movements
are often typed as a single line, such as:
   [##:##] Command : march 19 jjjh

Or  some  movements may be done partly on the command line and partly interac-
tively:

   [##:##] Command : march 18 yy

   Leader is cav  cavalry #0
    c .
    . h
   <105.6:105.6: -24,-2> l
   Your capital 100% efficient with 549 civ with 10 mil @ -5,-3
   Your highway 100% efficient with 549 civ with 0 mil @ -4,-2
   Your harbor 100% efficient with 549 civ with 109 mil @ -3,-1
    c .
    . h
   <105.6:105.6: -4,-2> yh
   cav  cavalry #0 stopped at -5,-3

You may also simply specify the destination sector.  In this  case,  the  land
units will take a cheapest path (in terms of mobility) to the destination sec-
tor.

For example,
   [##:##] Command : march 18 -6,-2

   Leader is cav  cavalry #0
   Using path 'yyh'
   cav  cavalry #0 stopped at -6,-2

See "info Mobility" for the mobility cost to march land units.

Land units entering a sector that has been mined may trip landmines (see "info
Hitchance").   Units with engineering capabilities can remove up to five mines
per pass through a sector (indicated by the message "Sweep...").   Such  units
also take 1/2 normal damage from mines.  See info lmine for more details.

Hostile  land/sea/air units may fire at/bomb/missile your units, if they're on
interdiction missions (see "info mission").  The chance of missiles and  bombs
hitting  your land units is determined by the land unit that is easiest to hit
(see "bomb" for the chance of hitting).  Any damage incurred is divided evenly
among  the  marching land units.  Collateral damage will be done to the sector
that the units were marching into.
