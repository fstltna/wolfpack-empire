NAME
   Products - Formulas for the production of commodities

Level: Basic

Many Empire sector types exist specifically to turn "raw" materials into prod-
ucts.  Some of those products may, in turn, be considered  raw  materials  for
other industries which produce other products.

The show command displays characteristics of products:

The columns are:
      product  The name of the product and the one-letter mnemonic of the com-
               modity made, if any.
         cost  Cost per unit of production.
raw materials  Raw materials for one unit of production.
     reso dep  Natural resource exploited, and its rate of depletion.
   level p.e.  Level production efficiency, for 100%  sector  type  production
               efficiency

How much a sector can produce is governed by the amount of "work" performed by
its populace, divided by the amount of raw materials per unit  of  production.
E.g.,  it  takes  3 units of "work" to produce 1 shell; 2 units to incorporate
the light construction materials and 1 unit for the heavy.  Mining a  "natural
resource"  such  as fertility takes one unit of work; e.g., it takes 1 unit of
work per unit of food produced.

How many products each unit of production makes depends on the  level  produc-
tion  efficiency,  which is the product's level p.e. (shown by "show product")
times the sector type's p.e. (shown by "show sect capabilities").   Production
requires a level p.e. above zero, obviously.

Say your country is at tech level 25.  Then your agribusinesses' level p.e. is
(25+10)/(25+20) * 900% = 7, i.e. they'll make 7 food per unit  of  production.
Your  shell  industries' level p.e. is only (25-20)/(25-10) * 100% = 1/3, i.e.
they'll make 1 shell per three units of production.  Your uranium mines  can't
produce at all, because their level p.e. is negative.
