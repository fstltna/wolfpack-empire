                               Command : RANGE

NAME
   range - Edit the range of a plane

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : range <PLANES> <range-limit>

The  "range"  command is used to limit the maximum range of individual planes.
This can be useful in setting up high tech interceptors (planes,  ABMs,  SAMs,
etc.) to cover only a small limited area.

Note  that  missiles  always fly at double range (since they don't need to fly
back), so you should cut the desired range in half before using the range com-
mand.

For  example, if plane 1 were a plane and you wanted to limit its reaction ra-
dius to 6, then you would type:
   [##:##] Command : range 1 6
and if plane 2 were a missile and you wanted to limit its reaction  radius  to
6, then you would type:
   [##:##] Command : range 2 3
