          UCB Empire Version 0.9.24 - Update for Version 1.2 Players

So you want to try the New Empire Huh?

Okay, I have written this document with YOU in mind!  Welcome to the Universi-
ty of California at Berkeley's Empire!   (From  now  on  called  UCB  Empire).
There are a whole bunch of changes in the game since we last played, so I need
to bring you up to date.

Our OLD EMPIRE game was Version 1.2 - written way back in the  70's  by  Peter
Langston, when he was going to College like we are!  But Empire has come along
way since then - and what many have considered the REAL EMPIRE was released in
1985 - containing the final version of Peter Langston's Empire game.  It still
is considered the "Standard".  But in 1986 the "computer brains"  at  Berkeley
decided  to  play  around with the Source Code and create their own "enhanced"
version of the game.  Hence "Berkeley Empire" was created....

                           Changes from Version 1.2

(Please keep in mind that these are only a FEW on the changes -  you're  going
to have to read the Manual and use the INFO command to get a REAL good idea on
what you should read up on - DON'T depend on this list to tell you  everything
you need to know)

There  is an "announce" command - this command sends a Telegram to EVERYONE in
the game - and you can make an "announcement" to the World.

In the OLD game - you simply dug up ORE and sent it  to  the  Shell,  Defense,
etc.   factory  to  have  it processed into something else (make guns, shells,
etc).

But in the NEW game - sectors are a lot more complex.  For one  thing  curtain
sectors  CAN'T even PRODUCE until your country has reached a given TECH level.
These sectors are currently:

Shell Factories  (need at least 20 TECH) Gun  Factories   (need  at  least  20
TECH)  Petroleum  Plants [ for Airplane Fuel ] (need at least 20 TECH) Uranium
Mines   (need at least 40 TECH)

Other sectors can produce normally, even though your TECH level  is  still  0.
Keep in mind that you CAN DESIGNATE the ABOVE sectors - but they won't produce
until you reach the desired TECH LEVEL.

Also, it takes more "Materials" to make 1 Unit of a finished product.  By this
I  mean that to make approximately "1 SHELL" at your shell factory, you'd have
to have: 3 Dollars (in the treasury), 2 LCM, 1 HCM, and at least 20 TECH  Lev-
el.

LCM  is Light Construction Materials, HCM is Heavy Construction Materials, and
I discussed the TECH Level problem (above).  To fully understand this  concept
- please see "info Products" and "info Sector-types".

FORTS  -  have been improved.  It used to be in OLD Empire that you had to use
the DEFEND command to say which sectors you wanted to  DEFEND  with  the  guns
from your fort.  But in the NEW Empire - your forts will fire on ANY enemy at-
tacker as long as the attacker is within the guns' range when the "attack" was
made.  Hence - no more DEFEND command.

FOOD  -  In  the OLD Empire you didn't have to worry about it - the people fed
themselves.  But in the NEW Empire - there is a new sector designation  called
"a"  for  agribusiness.  These are farms that make food and you have to trans-
port that food to other sectors that don't grow food  or  those  sectors  will
starve.  **NOTE** that in the "FERTILITY" rating in the "CENSUS" report - only
those with HIGH Fertility ratings can successfully grow food.  If the FERTILI-
TY  rating is in the 10-30% - BE CAREFUL - they may not be able to grow enough
food to sustain even themselves!  Food is also a  great  Commodity  to  "SELL"
(hint,hint!)

WEATHER  - There ISN'T ANY!  (no more rainy days :-) Although judging from the
way Berkeley has been improving the game - it won't be long till they  do  fix
it.   Can you imagine what weather will be like if they update it like the did
the "planes"!  Thunderstorms, tornadoes,  hurricanes,  earthquakes,  volcanos,
etc.   BUT  FOR NOW - THERE IS NO WEATHER - Atmosphere is stuck at "0" - clear
days!

NEXT UPDATE (how will I know when it is supposed to Happen?) - EMPIRE will al-
ways  tell you when the NEXT UPDATE is scheduled by using the VERSION command.
VERSION will also tell you how much food will grow per-update and also  things
like - how much food you people eat per update - etc.

MAP  CHANGES - in the OLD Empire you could move u)p, l)eft, r)ight, d)own, etc
- but now you have to move in DIAGONALS - you'll get used to it - the world is
set  up  like  this  so the game can handle more SECTORS per world.  Basically
means that the MAP display is more condensed - and you'll be able to see  more
sectors on a MAP display than ever before.

   A few new SECTOR-DESIGNATIONS have been added:

       BASICS                   INDUSTRIES                MILITARY / SCIENTIFIC
       .  sea                   d  defense plant          t  technical center
       ^  mountain              i  shell industry         f  fortress
       s  sanctuary             m  mine                   r  research lab
       /  wasteland             g  gold mine              n  nuclear plant
       -  wilderness            h  harbor                 l  library/school
       c  capital               w  warehouse              e  enlistment center
       p  park                  u  uranium mine           !  headquarters
       COMMUNICATIONS           *  airfield               FINANCIAL
       +  highway               a  agribusiness           b  bank
       )  radar installation    o  oil field
                                j  light manufacturing
       #  bridge head           k  heavy manufacturing
       =  bridge span           %  refinery

PLEASE!  Fully READ the "info Sector-types"

I  haven't  got time to go through all of them - but I will point out a few of
them that might be unfamiliar to you.

PARKS - these are special because they convince your people that  they  should
ENLIST and go out and fight for you!  Lots of fun - gotta have one of these to
keep the ENLISTMENT rate high.

URANIUM MINE - I forgot to add this above with the other  Commodities  -  with
the  Commodities "FERTILITY", "OIL", "GOLD", "MINE" - there is also "URANIUM".
Uranium is the most UNCOMMON natural resource and hence those that have a  de-
posit of it should be careful to guard it well.  When URANIUM is dug up it be-
comes "radioactive Matter" - you then deliver the Radioactive  Matter  to  the
Nuclear  Plant and have it converted into - you guessed it - NUKES!  Be aware,
however, that you must have a HIGH Tech level to make nukes - and it is  going
to take you a LONG TIME to get to this point.

REFINERY SECTORS: These are where the OIL you make is turned into PETROL(-eum)
for your various AIRPLANE needs.  Planes run on PETROL and the  refinery  sec-
tors make PETROL out of OIL.  You then have to deliver the PETROL to your Air-
ports for use...

LIBRARY/SCHOOL:  Obviously your people aren't very smart :-) As it is your go-
ing  to  need  to educated them.  Education will increase CROP yields and also
help with TECHNOLOGY.  see "info education".

                                World Updates

In the OLD EMPIRE - updates weren't handled in a FAIR way.  If you  created  a
0%  FORT before you logged out of Empire - it would REMAIN a 0% FORT until you
logged back into Empire - and if your on a LONG weekend that could have  meant
that you would be WIPED OUT!!!!

In  the  NEW EMPIRE - updates are handled by an independent program called the
"Transaction Manager".  This program runs independently of EMPIRE and runs  at
4  hours intervals, updating the game constantly.  That means that you enemies
will be updated just as often as you ARE - and may make them  think  a  little
more carefully about attacking you.  The CURRENT update times are:

2am, 6am, 10am, 2pm, 6pm, 10pm (In the local time zone)

NO OTHER UPDATES ARE POSSIBLE - except at these times.  What is updated is all
Mobility, Food Production, Shell & Factory Production, Ship Plane  and  Sector
Efficiency,  and  EVERYTHING that "update" used to do.  (hence there is NO Up-
date Command).  Everyone is updated at the SAME TIME!

                    Other Things That Might be of Interest

Terrorists!  - (real trouble makers, but great for setting on your  enemies  -
they blow up things and convert followers!)

SHOOT  -  it  is now possible to SHOOT your civilians (captured enemy ones) or
your own :-) God knows why you would but...  sometimes  the  conquered  people
are REAL radical and it DOES become necessary

SELL  - you can sell your goods on the OPEN Market - and set PRICE MULTIPLIERS
so that your enemies HAVE to buy at a BIG mark up - but your friends can still
buy your good cheap!

Okay  -  you've  been  waiting for it - so here it is!  The new line of Ships,
Planes and Nukes for Empire:

Only fishing boats and fishing trawlers accumulate food by fishing.

Only oil derricks accumulate oil at sea.

Only destroyers will drop depth charges, and only destroyers can see and  fire
