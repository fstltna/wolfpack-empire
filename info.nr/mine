                                Command : MINE

NAME
   mine - Drop sea mines from a ship

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : mine <SHIP> <NUMBER>

This  command  drops  mines in the sea and is functional from ships with mine-
laying capability (see "info Ship-types").

See "info Hitchance" for the chance of a ship hitting a mine.

In the command syntax <SHIP> is the number of one of your ships  and  <NUMBER>
is  the  number  of  mines you wish to drop.  That number of shells, (assuming
you've got them), will be dropped in the sector that ship occupies,  magically
becoming mines as they hit the water.

Mines  can  only  be removed safely by a minesweeper.  (Other ships can remove
them by hitting them, but...)  Planes with the 'sweep' ability can clear mines
by  flying recon missions through mined sectors, with each passage through the
sector possibly removing some mines.

Ships of tech 310 or higher can detect mines  with  their  sonar.   See  "info
sonar" for more information.

Note  that the sector is checked for possible mine hits only when a ship moves
into it; thus, a ship may safely drop mines in a sector and then move out.  On
the other hand, the mines know no allegiance, so moving back into a mined sec-
tor is foolish at best.

Building a bridge clears all mines there.

You cannot drop sea mines into a harbor, only land mines.
