                                Command : MOVE

NAME
   move - Transport ore, civilians, guns, etc

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : move <ITEM> <SECT> <NUMBER> <ROUTE|DESTINATION>

The  move  command is crucial to Empire; it carries out the movement of civil-
ians, military, ore, guns, shells, food, planes, etc. on land.  Note that  you
can  only move into sectors that you own, so you cannot take sectors via move.
To take sectors, use the "explore" command, which  uses  the  same  syntax  as
move.

<ITEM> can be any one of:

   c       civilians
   m       military
   u       uncompensated workers
   f       food
   g       guns
   s       shells
   p       petrol
   i       iron ore
   d       gold dust
   b       bars of gold
   l       light construction materials
   h       heavy construction materials
   r       radioactive materials

If  <SECT>  is  not provided in the command line, the program will request the
starting sector then display the number of mobility units in that sector,  its
designation, and its coordinates in the form:

   <97.0: a -6,4>

which  indicates  97  mobility units in agribusiness sector -6,4.  You may re-
spond with any combination of:

   y  for up-left
   u  for up-right               y    u
   g  for left                    \  /
   j  for right               g  --  --  j
   b  for down-left               /  \
   n  for down-right             b    n
   v  for view
   m  for map
   h  for end of movement

The "view" command shows the sector efficiency and some of the contents of the
sector you are currently occupying.

Since  the  <ROUTE> can be specified in the command line, simple movements are
often typed as a single line, such as:
   [##:##] Command : move m 2,0 20 jjjh
Or some movements may be done partly on the command line and  partly  interac-
tively:
   [##:##] Command : move c 2,2 18 jj

   <32.3: g 6,2> v
   10% gold mine with 3 civilians.
   <32.3: 6,2> h

You may also simply specify the destination sector.  In this case, empire will
set the path to be the cheapest path (in terms of mobility) from  the  current
sector to the destination sector, if such a path exists.

For example,
   [##:##] Command : move c 2,2 18 6,2

The  "map"  command will give you a map surrounding the current position.  You
can also supply additional parameters:
   [##:##] Command : <32.3: g 6,2> m # ls

is equivalent to a "map" command, like this:
   [##:##] Command : map # ls

Military control

In order to move something (other than military) out of  a  sector,  you  must
have  military  control  of the sector.  Military control is defined as having
military in the sector equal to at least  1/10th  the  number  of  unconverted
civilians there.

Military  in land units count towards military control.  Military in efficient
security units count double.

Mobility  See "info Mobility" for a description of how much mobility it  costs
to move something.

Mines  Note that while moving, you might hit mines. The more stuff you're mov-
ing, the greater the chance of setting off any mines in the sectors  you  move
through. See info lmine for more details.

Interdiction  Any  enemy units on interdiction mission may be triggered by the
move (the more you move, the bigger the chance they interdict).  The interdic-
tion  will damage the goods you are moving, and will also cause some damage to
the sector you were moving into.

Unhappy civilians

Also, when moving unhappy civilians (work percentage less than 100%), unhappi-
ness  is contagious. The work percentage of the destination sector is computed
by averaging the incoming civ's happiness with the happiness of the  civs  al-
ready there. For example, say you move 100 civs with work percentage of 0% in-
to a sector with 100 fully happy civilians (100% work). The work would be:
   ((migrants * their work) + (people at dest * their  work)  /  (total  civs)
((100 * 0%) + (100 * 100%)) / (100+100) =  100/200 = 50%

Plague  If  a  sector  is infected with the plague, then anything moved out of
the sector will infect the sector that it moves into.  Note that sectors moved
through will not catch the plague.
