                          Command : SINFRASTRUCTURE

NAME
   sinfrastructure - Report infrastructure of sectors

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : sinfrastructure <SECTS>

The  sinfrastructure  command  displays specific infrastructure information on
some or all of the sectors you occupy.

In the syntax of the census command <SECTS> is the  area  on  which  you  wish
information, (see "info syntax").

A typical usage might be:
   [##:##] Command : sinfrastructure 0:9,0:9 ?des=m
which would list data for mines in an area to the south-east of the capital.

A sinfrastructure lists each of your sectors in the specified area headed by:

                         road        rail       defense
     sect        eff   eff mcost   eff mcost   eff  fact

These columns represent:

        sect  the x and y coordinates of the sector
         eff  the  efficiency  of the sector (affects all benefits of a desig-
              nated sector except mobility and defense)
    road eff  the road efficiency of the sector
  road mcost  the mcost used to determine the mobility cost of  moving  things
              and marching non-train units through the sector
    rail eff  the rail efficiency of the sector
  rail  mcost  the  mcost used to determine the mobility cost of moving trains
              through the sector.  If the rail eff is 0,  trains  cannot  move
              through this sector.
 defense eff  the defense efficiency of the sector.
defense  fact  the  defense factor of the sector.  This is how well the sector
              defends.  All sectors start at 1, and  improve  (see  "improve")
              from there to the maximum shown in "show sect stats"

For example:
   [##:##] Command : sinf #0
