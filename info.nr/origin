                               Command : ORIGIN

NAME
   origin - Change the origin of your country's coordinate system

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : origin <SECTOR|COUNTRY|~>

This  command  moves the origin of your coordinate system (where 0,0 is locat-
ed).

You can move it to another sector, or to the  origin  of  an  allied  country.
Deities can also use a "~" argument to move it to absolute 0,0.

This command does not change the location of your nation's capital, though its
coordinates, like the coordinates of all other sectors, will be different  af-
ter using the origin command.

Your  "realms" will be automatically recalculated to point to the same area on
the map.
