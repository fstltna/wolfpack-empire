                               Command : POWER

NAME
   power - Display arbitrarily measured strengths of countries

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : power [new|update] [<NUM>|country <NATS>]

The  power report provides one view of national strengths.  It can be particu-
larly helpful in planning defense strategies.

Normally, the last saved power report is shown.  The optional arguments  "new"
and "update" request a new power report based on up-to-date information.  This
costs 10 BTUs.  The new report is saved for use by future power commands,  ex-
cept  when  a deity uses "update".  This lets deities examine up-to-date power
reports without affecting what players get to see.

If option AUTO_POWER is enabled, the command doesn't let you  save  new  power
reports.   Instead, the power report is updated automatically right before the
update.

If the optional "NUM" argument is given, only the top NUM entries in the power
chart  will  be displayed.  Note that for deities, if you give a negative num-
ber, only the top NUM entries in the power chart will be  displayed,  and  the
power number rating will not be displayed.

If the optional "country" argument is given, then the information is given for
those particular countries.

In the power report the countries are listed in  order  of  decreasing  "power
factor".   Powerless  countries are not shown unless explicitly requested with
the "country" argument.

The power report shows the following columns:

sects  number of sectors
  eff  average sector efficiency
  civ  number of civilians
  mil  number of military
shell  number of shells
  gun  number of guns
  pet  amount of petrol
 iron  amount of iron
 dust  amount of dust
  oil  amount of oil
  pln  number of planes
 ship  number of ships
 unit  number of land units
money  cash on hand

The "power factor" is determined by the following equation:

   power factor = (  power value of money
                   + power value of sectors
                   + power value of commodities in sectors
                   + power value of commodities loaded on ships and land units)
                  * (20 + nation tech level) / 500
                + power value of ships, planes, land units and nukes
                  * (20 + their tech level) / 500

The power value of money is dollars / 100.

The power value of a sector is (the power value of  the  materials  and  money
needed to build + maximum population / 1000 * 8 + 1) * efficiency / 100.

The  power value of a ship, plane, land unit or nuke is the power value of the
materials and money needed to build * efficiency / 100.

The power value of commodities is amount * type factor.  "show item" shows the
type factor in column "power".

Efficiency is in percent.
