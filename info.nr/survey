                               Command : SURVEY

NAME
   survey - Show distributions in map form

Level: Expert

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : survey <SELECTOR> <SECTS>

The survey command shows the distribution of some sector selector value in map
form.  This is especially useful for commodities and resources.

If <SELECTOR> can have large values, like  commodity  selectors,  then  survey
shows  hundreds, else tens of the value, as digits from 0 to 9.  Sectors which
have a value less or equal zero show up as blank.  Sectors whose value exceeds
999 or 99 respectively show up as '$'.

Surveyed sectors will be highlighted.

If  you  supply  conditions (see "info Syntax"), then sectors not matching the
conditions will not be surveyed, but have their current designation  displayed
as in a map instead.

Sectors not owned by you will show up as blanks.
