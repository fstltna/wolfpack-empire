NOTE: The following list is perennially incomplete and out of date.

The classification scheme used by report is dumb.

Guerrillas don't seem to carry the plague.

If  a  ship, plane, land unit or nuke is out to trade, and gets destroyed, and
its owner builds a new one that gets the same number, it will go on the  trad-
ing market automatically.

If  two  countries  are cooperating, its possible to raid an enemy airport and
steal the planes by putting them out to trade.

Two cooperative countries can move commodities around at no mobility cost  us-
ing the market.

You  can  collapse enemy bridges by making a lightning raid on his bridgeheads
and redesignating them, even if you only hold the bridgehead for a short time.

Player input lines are silently truncated after 1023 characters.
