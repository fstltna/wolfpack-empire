                                Command : READ

NAME
   read - Read your telegrams

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : read [yes|no|<CNUM/CNAME>]

The read command is used to read the telegrams sent you by other countries and
by the game, (e.g. when you make a sale or are attacked).

After reading all your telegrams you may delete them by  specifying  "yes"  or
not  by  specifying  "no" as an argument.  If an argument is not supplied then
you will be prompted to either answer "yes" or "no" to delete  the  telegrams.
If  you  supply or answer "no", the telegrams will remain pending but you will
not be reminded of them.

Deities can specify a <CNUM/CNAME> argument which selects  a  country's  tele-
grams  to  read.   If the <CNUM/CNAME> argument is supplied, the telegrams can
not be deleted.

When telegrams arrive you are informed with:

   "You have a new telegram waiting ..."   if there is just one new one, or
   "You have ten new telegrams waiting ..."   if there are ten of them, or
   "You have several new telegrams waiting ..."   if there are very many.

This command reads only telegrams & bulletins, use the 'wire' command to  read
announcements.
