NAME
   improve - Improve the infrastructure of a sector

Level: Basic

SYNTAX
   [##:##] Command : improve <road|rail|defense> <SECT> <NUM>

The improve command allows you to improve the efficiency of the infrastructure
of your sectors.

The infrastructure of your sectors affects how well they defend, and how  easy
it is for you to move various commodities/vehicles (land units) thorough them.

To  improve  a  sector, you need (most likely) lcms, hcms, mobility and money.
See "info show" for the various costs.

Whenever you tear down a sector, the infrastructure is left in tact.  The only
way that infrastructure goes down is when the sector takes damage.
